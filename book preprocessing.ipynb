      "THE FACTS\n",
      "1\n",
      "AN IMPORTANT PASSENGER ON THE TAURUS EXPRESS\n",
      "It was five o’clock on a winter’s morning in Syria. Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the\n",
      "train grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express. It consisted of a kitchen and\n",
      "dining-car, a sleeping-car and two local coaches.\n",
      "By the step leading up into the sleeping-car stood a young French lieutenant, resplendent in\n",
      "uniform conversing, with a small man muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a\n",
      "pink-tipped nose and the two points of an upward-curled moustache.\n",
      "It was freezingly cold, and this job of seeing off a distinguished stranger was not one to be\n",
      "envied, but Lieutenant Dubosc performed his part manfully. Graceful phrases fell from his lips in\n",
      "polished French. Not that he knew what it was all about. There had been rumours, of course, as\n",
      "there always were in such cases. The General’s—his General’s—temper had grown worse and\n",
      "worse. And then there had come this Belgian stranger—all the way from England, it seemed.\n",
      "There had been a week—a week of curious tensity. And then certain things had happened. A\n",
      "very distinguished officer had committed suicide, another had suddenly resigned, anxious faces\n",
      "had suddenly lost their anxiety, certain military precautions were relaxed. And the General,\n",
      "Lieutenant Dubosc’s own particular General, had suddenly looked ten years younger.\n",
      "Dubosc had overheard part of a conversation between him and the stranger. “You have saved\n",
      "us, mon cher,” said the General emotionally, his great white moustache trembling as he spoke.\n",
      "“You have saved the honour of the French Army—you have averted much bloodshed! How can I\n",
      "thank you for acceding to my request? To have come so far—”\n",
      "To which the stranger (by name M. Hercule Poirot) had made a fitting reply including the\n",
      "phrase—“But indeed, do I not remember that once you saved my life?” And then the General\n",
      "had made another fitting reply to that, disclaiming any merit for that past service; and with more\n",
      "mention of France, of Belgium, of glory, of honour and of such kindred things they had\n",
      "embraced each other heartily and the conversation had ended.\n",
      "As to what it had all been about, Lieutenant Dubosc was still in the dark, but to him had been\n",
      "delegated the duty of seeing off M. Poirot by the Taurus Express, and he was carrying it out with\n",
      "all the zeal and ardour befitting a young officer with a promising career ahead of him.\n",
      "“To-day is Sunday,” said Lieutenant Dubosc. “Tomorrow, Monday evening, you will be in\n",
      "Stamboul.”\n",
      "It was not the first time he had made this observation. Conversations on the platform, before\n",
      "the departure of a train, are apt to be somewhat repetitive in character.\n",
      "“That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.\n",
      "7Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“And you intend to remain there a few days, I think?”\n",
      "“Mais oui. Stamboul, it is a city I have never visited. It would be a pity to pass through—\n",
      "comme ça.” He snapped his fingers descriptively. “Nothing presses—I shall remain there as a\n",
      "tourist for a few days.”\n",
      "“La Sainte Sophie, it is very fine,” said Lieutenant Dubosc, who had never seen it.\n",
      "A cold wind came whistling down the platform. Both men shivered. Lieutenant Dubosc\n",
      "managed to cast a surreptitious glance at his watch. Five minutes to five—only five minutes\n",
      "more!\n",
      "Fancying that the other man had noticed his glance, he hastened once more into speech.\n",
      "“There are few people travelling this time of year,” he said, glancing up at the windows of the\n",
      "sleeping-car above them.\n",
      "“That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.\n",
      "“Let us hope you will not be snowed up in the Taurus!”\n",
      "“That happens?”\n",
      "“It has occurred, yes. Not this year, as yet.”\n",
      "“Let us hope, then,” said M. Poirot. “The weather reports from Europe, they are bad.\n",
      "“Very bad. In the Balkans there is much snow.”\n",
      "“In Germany, too, I have heard.”\n",
      "“Eh bien,” said Lieutenant Dubosc hastily as another pause seemed to be about to occur.\n",
      "“Tomorrow evening at seven-forty you will be in Constantinople.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said M. Poirot, and went on desperately, “La Sainte Sophie, I have heard it is very\n",
      "fine.”\n",
      "“Magnificent, I believe.”\n",
      "Above their heads the blinds of one of the sleeping-car compartments was pushed aside and a\n",
      "young woman looked out.\n",
      "Mary Debenham had had little sleep since she left Baghdad on the preceding Thursday.\n",
      "Neither in the train to Kirkuk, nor in the Rest House at Mosul, nor last night on the train had she\n",
      "slept properly. Now, weary of lying wakeful in the hot stuffiness of her overheated compartment,\n",
      "she got up and peered out.\n",
      "This must be Aleppo. Nothing to see, of course. Just a long, poorly lighted platform with\n",
      "loud, furious altercations in Arabic going on somewhere. Two men below her window were\n",
      "talking French. One was a French officer, the other was a little man with enormous moustaches.\n",
      "She smiled faintly. She had never seen anyone quite so heavily muffled up. It must be very cold\n",
      "outside. That was why they heated the train so terribly. She tried to force the window down\n",
      "lower, but it would not go.\n",
      "The Wagon Lit conductor had come up to the two men. The train was about to depart, he said.\n",
      "Monsieur had better mount. The little man removed his hat. What an egg-shaped head he had! In\n",
      "spite of her preoccupations Mary Debenham smiled. A ridiculous-looking little man. The sort of\n",
      "little man one could never take seriously.\n",
      "Lieutenant Dubosc was saying his parting speech. He had thought it out beforehand and had\n",
      "kept it till the last minute. It was a very beautiful, polished speech.\n",
      "Not to be outdone, M. Poirot replied in kind. ...\n",
      "“En voiture, Monsieur,” said the Wagon Lit conductor. With an air of infinite reluctance M.\n",
      "Poirot climbed aboard the train. The conductor climbed after him. M. Poirot waved his hand.\n",
      "Lieutenant Dubosc came to the salute. The train, with a terrific jerk, moved slowly forward.\n",
      "“Enfin!” murmured M. Hercule Poirot.\n",
      "8Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“Brrrrrrrr,” said Lieutenant Dubosc, realising to the full how cold he was.\n",
      "“Voilà, Monsieur!” The conductor displayed to Poirot with a dramatic gesture the beauty of\n",
      "his sleeping compartment and the neat arrangement of his luggage. “The little valise of\n",
      "Monsieur, I have put it here.”\n",
      "His outstretched hand was suggestive. Hercule Poirot placed in it a folded note.\n",
      "“Merci, Monsieur.” The conductor became brisk and business-like. “I have the tickets of\n",
      "Monsieur. I will also take the passport, please. Monsieur breaks his journey in Stamboul, I\n",
      "understand?”\n",
      "M. Poirot assented. “There are not many people travelling, I imagine?” he said.\n",
      "“No, Monsieur. I have only two other passengers—both English. A Colonel from India and a\n",
      "young English lady from Baghdad. Monsieur requires anything?”\n",
      "Monsieur demanded a small bottle of Perrier.\n",

      "She was, he judged, the kind of young woman who could take care of herself with perfect\n",

      "some mutual friends, which had the immediate effect of making them more friendly and less\n",

      "“The train, it is as dangerous as a sea voyage!”\n",
      "Miss Debenham said evenly that that would be very nice. Her manner was slightly repressive.\n",

      "“Oh! you mustn’t think that. The downtrodden governess is quite an exploded myth. I can\n",
      "assure you that it’s the parents who are afraid of being bullied by me.”\n",
      "They said no more. Arbuthnot was, perhaps, ashamed of his outburst.\n",

      "“Curious,” he said to himself.\n",
      "The next day he wondered whether, perhaps, they had quarrelled. They spoke little to each\n",
      "other. The girl, he thought, looked anxious. There were dark circles under her eyes.\n",
      "It was about half-past two in the afternoon when the train came to a halt. Heads were poked\n",
      "out of windows. A little knot of men were clustered by the side of the line looking and pointing\n",
      "at something under the dining-car.\n",
      "Poirot leaned out and spoke to the Wagon Lit conductor who was hurrying past. The man\n",
      "answered, and Poirot drew back his head and, turning, almost collided with Mary Debenham\n",
      "who was standing just behind him.\n",
      "“What is the matter?” she asked rather breathlessly in French. “Why are we stopping?”\n",
      "“It is nothing, Mademoiselle. It is something that has caught fire under the dining-car.\n",
      "Nothing serious. It is put out. They are now repairing the damage. There is no danger, I assure\n",

      "She made a little abrupt gesture, as though she were waving the idea of danger aside as\n",

      "“Yes, yes, I understand that. But the time!”\n",
      "“The time?”\n",
      "“Yes, this will delay us.”\n",
      "“It is possible—yes,” agreed Poirot.\n",
      "“But we can’t afford delay! This train is due in at 6.55, and one has to cross the Bosphorus\n",
      "and catch the Simplon Orient Express on the other side at nine o’clock. If there is an hour or two\n",
      "of delay we shall miss the connection.”\n",
      "“It is possible, yes,” he admitted.\n",
      "He looked at her curiously. The hand that held the window bar was not quite steady; her lips,\n",
      "too, were trembling.\n",
      "“Does it matter to you very much, Mademoiselle?” he asked.\n",
      "“Yes. Yes, it does. I—I must catch that train.”\n",
      "She turned away from him and went down the corridor to join Colonel Arbuthnot.\n",
      "Her anxiety, however, was needless. Ten minutes later the train started again. It arrived at\n",
      "Hayda-passar only five minutes late, having made up time on the journey.\n",
      "The Bosphorus was rough and M. Poirot did not enjoy the crossing. He was separated from\n",

      "“It was clearly not a scientific crime,” said Poirot.\n",
      "“It was most unscientific,” returned Dr. Constantine. “The blows seem to have been delivered\n",

      "“No, I think I’ve got a couple still in my files—one I know Ratchett tore up in a rage. Shall I\n",
      "get them for you?”\n",
      "“If you would be so good.”\n",
      "MacQueen left the compartment. He returned a few minutes later and laid down two sheets of\n",
      "rather dirty notepaper before Poirot.\n",
      "The first letter ran as follows:\n",
      "Thought you’d double-cross us and get away with it, did you? Not on your life. We’re out\n",
      "to GET you, Ratchett, and we WILL get you!\n",
      "There was no signature.\n",
      "With no comment beyond raised eyebrows, Poirot picked up the second letter.\n",
      "We’re going to take you for a ride, Ratchett. Some time soon. We’re going to GET you—\n",
      "see?\n",
      "Poirot laid the letter down.\n",
      "“The style is monotonous!” he said. “More so than the handwriting.”\n",
      "MacQueen stared at him.\n",
      "“You would not observe,” said Poirot pleasantly. “It requires the eye of one used to such\n",
      "things. This letter was not written by one person, M. MacQueen. Two or more persons wrote it—\n",
      "each writing one letter of a word at a time. Also, the letters are printed. That makes the task of\n",
      "identifying the handwriting much more difficult.” He paused, then said: “Did you know that M.\n",
      "Ratchett had applied for help to me?”\n",
      "“To you?”\n",
      "MacQueen’s astonished tone told Poirot quite certainly that the young man had not known of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "The detective nodded. “Yes. He was alarmed. Tell me, how did he act when he received the\n",
      "first letter?”\n",
      "MacQueen hesitated.\n",
      "“It’s difficult to say. He—he—passed it off with a laugh in that quiet way of his. But\n",
      "somehow—” he gave a slight shiver—“I felt that there was a good deal going on underneath the\n",
      "quietness.”\n",
      "Poirot nodded. Then he asked an unexpected question.\n",
      "“Mr. MacQueen, will you tell me, quite honestly, exactly how you regarded your employer?\n",
      "Did you like him?”\n",
      "Hector MacQueen took a moment or two before replying.\n",
      "31Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“No,” he said at last. “I did not.”\n",
      "“Why.”\n",
      "“I can’t exactly say. He was always quite pleasant in his manner.” He paused, then said: “I’ll\n",
      "tell you the truth, Mr. Poirot. I disliked and distrusted him. He was, I am sure, a cruel and\n",
      "dangerous man. I must admit, though, that I have no reasons to advance for my opinion.”\n",
      "“Thank you, Mr. MacQueen. One further question: when did you last see Mr. Ratchett alive?”\n",
      "“Last evening about—” he thought for a minute—“ten o’clock, I should say. I went into his\n",
      "compartment to take down some memoranda from him.”\n",
      "“On what subject?”\n",
      "“Some tiles and antique pottery that he bought in Persia. What had been delivered was not\n",
      "what he had purchased. There has been a long, vexatious correspondence on the subject.”\n",
      "“And that was the last time Mr. Ratchett was seen alive?”\n",
      "“Yes, I suppose so.”\n",
      "“Do you know when Mr. Ratchett received the last threatening letter?”\n",
      "“On the morning of the day we left Constantinople.”\n",
      "“There is one more question I must ask you, Mr. MacQueen. Were you on good terms with\n",
      "your employer?”\n",
      "The young man’s eyes twinkled suddenly.\n",
      "“This is where I’m supposed to go all goosefleshy down the back. In the words of a best\n",
      "seller, ‘You’ve nothing on me.’ Ratchett and I were on perfectly good terms.”\n",
      "“Perhaps, Mr. MacQueen, you will give me your full name and your address in America.”\n",
      "MacQueen gave his name—Hector Willard MacQueen—and an address in New York.\n",
      "Poirot leaned back against the cushions.\n",
      "“That is all for the present, Mr. MacQueen,” he said. “I should be obliged if you would keep\n",
      "the matter of Mr. Ratchett’s death to yourself for a little time.”\n",
      "“His valet, Masterman, will have to know.”\n",
      "“He probably knows already,” said Poirot drily. “If so, try to get him to hold his tongue.”\n",
      "“That oughtn’t to be difficult. He’s a Britisher and, as he calls it, he ‘keeps to himself.’ He has\n",
      "a low opinion of Americans, and no opinion at all of any other nationality.”\n",
      "“Thank you, Mr. MacQueen.”\n",
      "The American left the carriage.\n",
      "“Well?” demanded M. Bouc. “You believe what he says, this young man?”\n",
      "“He seems honest and straightforward. He did not pretend to any affection for his employer,\n",
      "as he probably would have done had he been involved in any way. It is true, Mr. Ratchett did not\n",
      "tell him that he had tried to enlist my services and failed, but I do not think that that is really a\n",
      "suspicious circumstance. I fancy Mr. Ratchett was a gentleman who kept his own counsel on\n",
      "every possible occasion.”\n",
      "“So you pronounce one person at least innocent of the crime,” said M. Bouc jovially.\n",
      "Poirot cast on him a look of reproach.\n",
      "“Me, I suspect everybody till the last minute,” he said. “All the same, I must admit that I\n",
      "cannot see this sober, long-headed MacQueen losing his head and stabbing his victim twelve or\n",
      "fourteen times. It is not in accord with his psychology—not at all.”\n",
      "“No,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully. “That is the act of a man driven almost crazy with a\n",

      "THE BODY\n",
      "Followed by Dr. Constantine, Poirot made his way to the next coach and to the compartment\n",
      "occupied by the murdered man. The conductor came and unlocked the door for them with his\n",
      "key.\n",
      "The two men passed inside. Poirot turned inquiringly to his companion.\n",
      "“How much has been disarranged in this compartment?”\n",
      "“Nothing has been touched. I was careful not to move the body in making my examination.”\n",
      "Poirot nodded. He looked round him.\n",
      "The first thing that struck the senses was the intense cold. The window was pushed down as\n",
      "far as it would go, and the blind was drawn up.\n",
      "“Brrr,” observed Poirot.\n",
      "The other smiled appreciatively.\n",
      "“I did not like to close it,” he said.\n",
      "Poirot examined the window carefully.\n",
      "“You are right,” he announced. “Nobody left the carriage this way. Possibly the open window\n",
      "was intended to suggest that somebody did; but if so, the snow has defeated the murderer’s\n",
      "intention.”\n",
      "He examined the frame of the window carefully. Taking a small case from his pocket he blew\n",
      "a little powder over the frame.\n",
      "“No fingerprints at all,” he said. “That means it: has been wiped. Well, if there had been\n",
      "fingerprints they would have told us very little. They would have been those of Mr. Ratchett or\n",
      "his valet or the conductor. Criminals do not make mistakes of that kind nowadays.\n",
      "“And that being so,” he added cheerfully, “we might as well shut the window. Positively it is\n",
      "the cold storage in here!”\n",
      "He suited the action to the word and then turned his attention for the first time to the\n",
      "motionless figure lying in the bunk.\n",
      "Ratchett lay on his back. His pyjama jacket, stained with rusty patches, had been unbuttoned\n",
      "and thrown back.\n",
      "“I had to see the nature of the wounds, you see,” explained the doctor.\n",
      "Poirot nodded. He bent over the body. Finally he straightened himself with a slight grimace.\n",
      "“It is not pretty,” he said. “Someone must have stood there and stabbed him again and again.\n",
      "How many wounds are there exactly?”\n",
      "“I make it twelve. One or two are so slight as to be practically scratches. On the other hand, at\n",
      "least three would be capable of causing death.”\n",
      "Something in the doctor’s tone caught Poirot’s attention. He looked at him sharply. The little\n",
      "Greek was standing staring down at the body with a puzzled frown.\n",
      "“Something strikes you as odd, does it not?” he asked gently. “Speak, my friend. There is\n",
      "something here that puzzles you?”\n",
      "“You are right,” acknowledged the other.\n",
      "“What is it?”\n",
      "33Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“You see these two wounds—here and here—” He pointed. “They are deep. Each cut must\n",
      "have severed blood vessels—and yet the edges do not gape. They have not bled as one would\n",
      "have expected.”\n",
      "“Which suggests?”\n",
      "“That the man was already dead—some little time dead—when they were delivered. But that\n",
      "is surely absurd.”\n",
      "“It would seem so,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Unless our murderer figured to himself that he\n",
      "had not accomplished his job properly and came back to make quite sure—but that is manifestly\n",
      "absurd! Anything else?”\n",
      "“Well, just one thing.”\n",
      "“And that?”\n",
      "“You see this wound here—under the right arm—near the right shoulder. Take this pencil of\n",
      "mine. Could you deliver such a blow?”\n",
      "Poirot poised his hand.\n",
      "“Précisément,” he said. “I see. With the right hand it is exceedingly difficult, almost\n",
      "impossible. One would have to strike backhanded, as it were. But if the blow were struck with\n",
      "the left hand—”\n",
      "“Exactly, M. Poirot. That blow was almost certainly struck with the left hand.”\n",
      "“So that our murderer is left-handed? No, it is more difficult than that, is it not?”\n",
      "“As you say, M. Poirot. Some of these other blows are just as obviously right-handed.”\n",
      "“Two people. We are back at two people again,” murmured the detective. He asked abruptly:\n",
      "“Was the electric light on?”\n",
      "“It is difficult to say. You see, it is turned off by the conductor every morning about ten\n",
      "o’clock.”\n",
      "“The switches will tell us,” said Poirot.\n",
      "He examined the switch of the top light and also the roll-back bed-head light. The former was\n",
      "turned off. The latter was closed.\n",
      "“Eh bien,” he said thoughtfully. “We have here a hypothesis of the First and the Second\n",
      "Murderer, as the great Shakespeare would put it. The First Murderer stabbed his victim and left\n",
      "the compartment, turning off the light. The Second Murderer came in in the dark, did not see that\n",
      "his or her work had been done, and stabbed at least twice at a dead body. Que pensez-vous de\n",
      "ça?”\n",
      "“Magnificent!” said the little doctor with enthusiasm.\n",
      "The other’s eyes twinkled.\n",
      "“You think so? I am glad. It sounded to me a little like the nonsense.”\n",
      "“What other explanation can there be?”\n",
      "“That is just what I am asking myself. Have we here a coincidence, or what? Are there any\n",
      "other inconsistencies, such as would point to two people being concerned?”\n",
      "“I think I can say yes. Some of these blows, as I have already said, point to a weakness—a\n",
      "lack of strength or a lack of determination. They are feeble, glancing blows. But this one here—\n",
      "and this one—” Again he pointed. “Great strength was needed for those blows. They have\n",
      "penetrated the muscle.”\n",
      "“They were, in your opinion, delivered by a man?”\n",
      "“Most certainly.”\n",
      "“They could not have been delivered by a woman?”\n",
      "34Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“A young, vigorous, athletic woman might have struck them, especially if she were in the grip\n",
      "of a strong emotion; but it is in my opinion highly unlikely.”\n",
      "Poirot was silent a moment or two.\n",
      "The other asked anxiously, “You understand my point?”\n",
      "“Perfectly,” said Poirot. “The matter begins to clear itself up wonderfully! The murderer was\n",
      "a man of great strength—he was feeble—it was a woman—it was a right-handed person—it was\n",
      "a left-handed person. Ah! c’est rigolo, tout ça!” He spoke with sudden anger. “And the victim—\n",
      "what does he do in all this? Does he cry out? Does he struggle? Does he defend himself?”\n",
      "He slipped his hand under the pillow and drew out the automatic pistol which Ratchett had\n",
      "shown him the day before.\n",
      "“Fully loaded, you see,” he said.\n",
      "They looked round them. Ratchett’s day clothing was hanging from the hooks on the wall. On\n",
      "the small table formed by the lid of the wash basin were various objects. False teeth in a glass of\n",
      "water. Another glass, empty. A bottle of mineral water. A large flask. An ash-tray containing the\n",
      "butt of a cigar and some charred fragments of paper; also two burnt matches.\n",
      "The doctor picked up the empty glass and sniffed it.\n",
      "“Here is the explanation of the victim’s inertia,” he said quietly.\n",
      "“Drugged?”\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "Poirot nodded. He picked up the two matches and scrutinised them carefully.\n",
      "“You have a clue then?” demanded the little doctor eagerly.\n",
      "“Those two matches are of different shapes,” said Poirot. “One is flatter than the other. You\n",
      "see?”\n",
      "“It is the kind you get on the train,” said the doctor. “In paper covers.”\n",
      "Poirot was feeling in the pockets of Ratchett’s clothing. Presently he pulled out a box of\n",
      "matches. He compared them carefully with the burnt ones.\n",
      "“The rounder one is a match struck by Mr. Ratchett,” he said. “Let us see if he had also the\n",
      "flatter kind.”\n",
      "But a further search showed no other matches.\n",
      "Poirot’s eyes were darting about the compartment. They were bright and sharp like a bird’s.\n",
      "One felt that nothing could escape their scrutiny.\n",
      "With a little exclamation he bent and picked-up something from the floor.\n",
      "It was a small square of cambric, very dainty. In the corner was an embroidered initial—H.\n",
      "“A woman’s handkerchief,” said the doctor. “Our friend the chef de train was right. There is a\n",
      "woman concerned in this.”\n",
      "“And most conveniently she leaves her handkerchief behind!” said Poirot. “Exactly as it\n",
      "happens in the books and on the films—and to make things even easier for us, it is marked with\n",
      "an initial.”\n",
      "“What a stroke of luck for us!” exclaimed the doctor.\n",
      "“Is it not?” said Poirot.\n",
      "Something in his tone surprised the doctor, but before he could ask for elucidation Poirot had\n",
      "made another dive onto the floor.\n",
      "This time he held out on the palm of his hand—a pipe-cleaner.\n",
      "“It is perhaps the property of Mr. Ratchett?” suggested the doctor.\n",
      "“There was no pipe in any of his pockets, and no tobacco or tobacco pouch.”\n",
      "“Then it is a clue.”\n",
      "35Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“Oh! decidedly. And again dropped most conveniently. A masculine clue, this time, you note!\n",
      "One cannot complain of having no clues in this case. There are clues here in abundance. By the\n",
      "way, what have you done with the weapon?”\n",
      "“There was no sign of any weapon. The murderer must have taken it away with him.”\n",
      "“I wonder why,” mused Poirot.\n",
      "“Ah!” The doctor had been delicately exploring the pyjama pockets of the dead man.\n",
      "“I overlooked this,” he said. “I unbuttoned the jacket and threw it straight back.”\n",
      "From the breast pocket he brought out a gold watch. The case was dented savagely, and the\n",
      "hands pointed to a quarter past one.\n",
      "“You see?” cried Constantine eagerly. “This gives us the hour of the crime. It agrees with my\n",
      "calculations. Between midnight and two in the morning is what I said, and probably about one\n",
      "o’clock, though it is difficult to be exact in these matters. Eh bien, here is confirmation. A\n",
      "quarter past one. That was the hour of the crime.”\n",
      "“It is possible, yes. It is certainly possible.”\n",
      "The doctor looked at him curiously. “You will pardon me, M. Poirot, but I do not quite\n",
      "understand you.”\n",
      "“I do not understand myself,” said Poirot. “I understand nothing at all. And, as you perceive,\n",
      "it worries me.”\n",
      "He sighed and bent over the little table examining the charred fragment of paper. He\n",
      "murmured to himself, “What I need at this moment is an old-fashioned woman’s hat-box.”\n",
      "Dr. Constantine was at a loss to know what to make of this singular remark. In any case Poirot\n",
      "gave him no time for questions. Opening the door into the corridor, he called for the conductor.\n",
      "The man arrived at a run.\n",
      "“How many women are there in this coach?”\n",
      "The conductor counted on his fingers.\n",
      "“One, two, three—six, Monsieur. The old American lady, a Swedish lady, the young English\n",
      "lady, the Countess Andrenyi, and Madame la Princesse Dragomiroff and her maid.”\n",
      "Poirot considered.\n",
      "“They all have hat-boxes, yes?”\n",
      "“Yes, Monsieur.”\n",
      "“Then bring me—let me see—yes, the Swedish lady’s and that of the lady’s-maid. Those two\n",
      "are the only hope. You will tell them it is a customs regulation—something—anything that\n",
      "occurs to you.”\n",
      "“That will be all right, Monsieur. Neither lady is in her compartment at the moment.”\n",
      "“Then be quick.”\n",
      "The conductor departed. He returned with the two hatboxes. Poirot opened that of the maid,\n",
      "and tossed it aside. Then he opened the Swedish lady’s and uttered an exclamation of\n",
      "satisfaction. Removing the hats carefully, he disclosed round humps of wire-netting.\n",
      "“Ah, here is what we need! About fifteen years ago hat-boxes were made like this. You\n",
      "skewered through the hat with a hatpin on to this hump of wire-netting.”\n",
      "As he spoke he was skillfully removing two of the attached humps. Then he repacked the hat-\n",
      "box and told the conductor to return both boxes where they belonged.\n",
      "When the door was shut once more he turned to his companion.\n",
      "“See you, my dear doctor, me, I am not one to rely upon the expert procedure. It is the\n",
      "psychology I seek, not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash. But in this case I would welcome a\n",
      "36Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "little scientific assistance. This compartment is full of clues, but can I be sure that those clues are\n",
      "really what they seem to be?”\n",
      "“I do not quite understand you, M. Poirot.”\n",
      "“Well, to give you an example—we find a woman’s handkerchief. Did a woman drop it? Or\n",
      "did a man, committing the crime, say to himself: ‘I will make this look like a woman’s crime. I\n",
      "will stab my enemy an unnecessary number of times, making some of the blows feeble and\n",
      "ineffective, and I will drop this handkerchief where no one can miss it’? That is one possibility.\n",
      "Then there is another. Did a woman kill him, and did she deliberately drop a pipe-cleaner to\n",
      "make it look like a man’s work? Or are we seriously to suppose that two people, a man and a\n",
      "woman, were separately concerned, and that each was so careless as to drop a clue to his or her\n",
      "identity? It is a little too much of a coincidence, that!”\n",
      "“But where does the hat-box come in?” asked the doctor, still puzzled.\n",
      "“Ah! I am coming to that. As I say, these clues—the watch stopped at a quarter past one, the\n",
      "handkerchief, the pipe-cleaner—they may be genuine, or they may be faked. As to that I cannot\n",
      "yet tell. But there is one clue here which—though again I may be wrong—I believe has not been\n",
      "faked. I mean this flat match, M. le docteur. I believe that that match was used by the murderer,\n",
      "not by Mr. Ratchett. It was used to burn an incriminating paper of some kind. Possibly a note. If\n",
      "so, there was something in that note, some mistake, some error, that left a possible clue to the\n",
      "assailant. I am going to try to discover what that something was.”\n",
      "He went out of the compartment and returned a few moments later with a small spirit stove\n",
      "and a pair of curling-tongs.\n",
      "“I use them for the moustaches,” he said, referring to the latter.\n",
      "The doctor watched him with great interest. Poirot flattened out the two humps of wire, and\n",
      "with great care wriggled the charred scrap of paper on to one of them. He clapped the other on\n",
      "top of it and then, holding both pieces together with the tongs, held the whole thing over the\n",
      "flame of the spirit-lamp.\n",
      "“It is a very makeshift affair, this,” he said over his shoulder. “Let us hope that it will answer\n",
      "our purpose.”\n",
      "The doctor watched the proceedings attentively. The metal began to glow. Suddenly he saw\n",
      "faint indications of letters. Words formed themselves slowly-words of fire.\n",
      "It was a very tiny scrap. Only three words and part of another showed.\n",
      "—member little Daisy Armstrong\n",
      "“Ah!” Poirot gave a sharp exclamation.\n",
      "“It tells you something?” asked the doctor.\n",
      "Poirot’s eyes were shining. He laid down the tongs carefully.\n",
      "“Yes,” he said. “I know the dead man’s real name. I know why he had to leave America.”\n",
      "“What was his name?”\n",
      "“Cassetti.”\n",
      "“Cassetti?” Constantine knitted his brows. “It brings back to me something. Some years ago. I\n",
      "cannot remember. ... It was a case in America, was it not?”\n",
      "“Yes,” said Poirot. “A case in America.”\n",
      "Further than that Poirot was not disposed to be communicative. He looked round him as he\n",
      "went on:\n",
      "37Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“We will go into all that presently. Let us first make sure that we have seen all there is to be\n",
      "seen here.”\n",
      "Quickly and deftly he went once more through the pockets of the dead man’s clothes but\n",
      "found nothing there of interest. He tried the communicating door which led through to the next\n",
      "compartment, but it was bolted on the other side.\n",
      "“There is one thing that I do not understand,” said Dr. Constantine. “If the murderer did not\n",

      "“I am glad you admit that at least.”\n",
      "Poirot went on calmly, unperturbed by the interruption. “We have before us three\n",
      "possibilities.\n",
      "86Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“(1)—that the crime was committed, as you say, at a quarter past one. This is supported by the\n",
      "evidence of the watch, by the evidence of Mrs. Hubbard, and by the evidence of the German\n",
      "woman, Hildegarde Schmidt. It agrees with the evidence of Dr. Constantine.\n",
      "“(2)—that the crime was committed later, and that the evidence of the watch was deliberately\n",
      "faked in order to mislead.\n",
      "“(3)—that the crime was committed earlier, and the evidence faked for the same reason as\n",
      "above.\n",
      "“Now if we accept possibility (1) as the most likely to have occurred, and the one supported\n",
      "by most evidence, we must also accept certain facts arising from it. If the crime was committed\n",
      "at a quarter past one, the murderer cannot have left the train, and the questions arise: Where is\n",
      "he? And who is he?\n",
      "“To begin with, let us examine the evidence carefully. We first hear of the existence of this\n",
      "man—the small dark man with a womanish voice—from the man Hardman. He says that\n",
      "Ratchett told him of this person and employed him to watch out for the man. There is no\n",
      "evidence to support this; we have only Hardman’s word for it. Let us next examine the question:\n",
      "Is Hardman the person he pretends to be an operative of a New York detective agency?\n",
      "“What to my mind is so interesting in this case is that we have none of the facilities afforded\n",
      "to the police. We cannot investigate the bona fides of any of these people. We have to rely solely\n",
      "on deduction. That, to me, makes the matter very much more interesting. There is no routine\n",
      "work. It is all a matter of the intellect. I ask myself: Can we accept Hardman’s account of\n",
      "himself? I make my decision and I answer ‘Yes.’ I am of the opinion that we can accept\n",
      "Hardman’s account of himself.”\n",
      "“You rely on the intuition? What the Americans call ‘the hunch’?” asked Dr. Constantine.\n",
      "“Not at all. I regard the probabilities. Hardman is travelling with a false passport—that will at\n",
      "once make him an object of suspicion. The first thing that the police will do when they do arrive\n",
      "upon the scene is to detain Hardman and cable as to whether his account of himself is true. In the\n",
      "case of many of the passengers, to establish their bona fides will be difficult; in most cases it will\n",
      "probably not be attempted, especially since there seems nothing in the way of suspicion attaching\n",
      "to them. But in Hardman’s case it is simple. Either he is the person he represents himself to be,\n",
      "or he is not. Therefore I say that all will prove to be in order.”\n",
      "“You acquit him of suspicion?”\n",
      "“Not at all. You misunderstand me. For all I know, any American detective might have his\n",
      "own private reasons for wishing to murder Ratchett. No, what I am saying is that I think we can\n",
      "accept Hardman’s own account of himself. This story, then, that he tells of Ratchett’s seeking\n",
      "him out and employing him is not unlikely, and is most probably—though not of course\n",
      "certainly—true. If we are going to accept it as true, we must see if there is any confirmation of it.\n",
      "We find it in rather an unlikely place—in the evidence of Hildegarde Schmidt. Her description of\n",
      "the man she saw in Wagon Lit uniform tallies exactly. Is there any further confirmation of these\n",
      "two stories? There is. There is the button that Mrs. Hubbard found in her compartment. And\n",
      "there is also another corroborating statement which you may not have noticed.”\n",
      "“What is that?”\n",
      "“The fact that both Colonel Arbuthnot and Hector MacQueen mention that the conductor\n",
      "passed their carriage. They attached no importance to the fact, but, Messieurs, Pierre Michel has\n",
      "declared that he did not leave his seat except on certain specified occasions—none of which\n",

      "“Therefore this story, the story of a small dark man with a womanish voice dressed in Wagon\n",

      "102Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“Ah, it is that you want it given to you in words of one syllable. Well, here it is! M. Ratchett\n",
      "spoke no French. Yet, when the conductor came in answer to his bell last night, it was a voice\n",

      "moreover, a perfectly idiomatic phrase that was used, not one that a man knowing only a few\n",

      "“In one way,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully, “this discovery does not affect things very much.\n",
      "You heard someone moving about next door. That someone was not Ratchett, but the other man.\n",
      "Doubtless he is washing blood from his hands, clearing up after the crime, burning the\n",

      "clear, he locks and chains Ratchett’s door on the inside, unlocks the communicating door through\n",

      "quarter past one to create an alibi.”\n",
      "“Not such a famous alibi,” said Poirot. “The hands of the watch pointed to 1.15—the exact\n",

      "“True,” said M. Bouc, a little confused. “What then does the watch convey to you?”\n",
      "“If the hands were altered—I say if—then the time at which they were set must have a\n",

      "“Yes, yes,” said the doctor. “That reasoning is good.”\n",
      "“We must also pay a little attention to the time the intruder entered the compartment. When\n",
      "had he an opportunity of doing so? Unless we are to assume the complicity of the real conductor,\n",
      "there was only one time when he could have done so—during the time the train stopped at\n",

      "any one of the passengers would pay little attention to a Wagon Lit attendant, the one person\n",
      "who would notice an impostor is the real conductor. But during the halt at Vincovci the\n",

      "2\n",
      "TEN QUESTIONS\n",
      "On the paper was written:\n",
      "THINGS NEEDING EXPLANATION\n",
      "1. The handkerchief marked with the initial H. Whose is it?\n",
      "2. The pipe-cleaner. Was it dropped by Colonel Arbuthnot? Or by someone else?\n",
      "3. Who wore the scarlet kimono?\n",
      "4. Who was the man or woman masquerading in Wagon Lit uniform?\n",
      "5. Why do the hands of the watch point to 1.15?\n",
      "6. Was the murder committed at that time?\n",
      "7. Was it earlier?\n",
      "8. Was it later?\n",
      "9. Can we be sure that Ratchett was stabbed by more than one person?\n",
      "10. What other explanation of his wounds can there be?\n",
      "“Well, let us see what we can do,” said M. Bouc, brightening a little at this challenge to his\n",
      "wits. The handkerchief, to begin with. Let us by all means be orderly and methodical.”\n",
      "“Assuredly,” said Poirot, nodding his head in a satisfied fashion.\n",
      "M. Bouc continued somewhat didactically.\n",
      "The initial H is connected with three people—Mrs. Hubbard, Miss Debenham, whose second\n",
      "name is Hermione, and the maid Hildegarde Schmidt.”\n",
      "“Ah! And of those three?”\n",
      "“It is difficult to say. But I think I should vote for Miss Debenham. For all one knows she may\n",
      "be called by her second name and not her first. Also there is already some suspicion attaching to\n",
      "her. That conversation you overheard, mon cher, was certainly a little curious, and so is her\n",
      "refusal to explain it.”\n",
      "“As for me, I plump for the American,” said Dr. Constantine. “It is a very expensive\n",
      "handkerchief, that; and Americans, as all the world knows, do not care what they pay.”\n",
      "“So you both eliminate the maid?” asked Poirot.\n",
      "“Yes. As she herself said, it is the handkerchief of a member of the upper classes.”\n",
      "And the second question—the pipe-cleaner. Did Colonel Arbuthnot drop it, or somebody\n",
      "else?”\n",
      "“That is more difficult. The English, they do not stab. You are right there. I incline to the view\n",
      "that someone else dropped the pipe-cleaner—and did so to incriminate the long-legged\n",
      "Englishman.”\n",
      "“As you said, M. Poirot,” put in the doctor, “two clues is too much carelessness. I agree with\n",
      "M. Bouc. The handkerchief was a genuine oversight—hence none of the women will admit that\n",
      "it is hers. The pipe-cleaner is a faked clue. In support of that theory, you notice that Colonel\n",
      "Arbuthnot shows no embarrassment and admits freely to smoking a pipe and using that type of\n",
      "cleaner.”\n",
      "106Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“You reason well,” said Poirot.\n",
      "“Question No. 3—Who wore the scarlet kimono!” went on M. Bouc. “As to that, I will\n",
      "confess I have not the slightest idea. Have you any views on the subject, Dr. Constantine?”\n",
      "“None.”\n",
      "“Then we confess ourselves beaten there. The next question has, at any rate, possibilities.\n",
      "Who was the man or the woman masquerading in Wagon Lit uniform? Well, one can list with\n",
      "certainty a number of people that it could not have been. Hardman, Colonel Arbuthnot,\n",
      "Foscarelli, Count Andrenyi and Hector MacQueen are all too tall. Mrs. Hubbard, Hildegarde\n",
      "Schmidt and Greta Ohlsson are too broad. That leaves the valet, Miss Debenham, Princess\n",
      "Dragomiroff and Countess Andrenyi—and none of them sounds likely! Greta Ohlsson in one\n",
      "case, and Antonio Foscarelli in the other, both swear that Miss Debenham and the valet never left\n",
      "their compartments. Hildegarde Schmidt swears that the Princess was in hers, and Count\n",
      "Andrenyi has told us that his wife took a sleeping draught. Therefore it seems impossible that it\n",
      "can be anybody—which is absurd!”\n",
      "“As our old friend Euclid says,” murmured Poirot.\n",
      "“It must be one of those four,” said Dr. Constantine. “Unless it is someone from outside who\n",
      "has found a hiding-place—and that we agreed was impossible.”\n",
      "M. Bouc had passed on to the next question on the list.\n",
      "“No. 5—Why do the hands of the broken watch point to 1.15? I can see two explanations of\n",
      "that. Either it was done by the murderer to establish an alibi, and afterwards, when he meant to\n",
      "leave the compartment, he was prevented by hearing people moving about; or else—wait—I\n",
      "have an idea coming—”\n",
      "The other two waited respectfully while M. Bouc struggled in mental agony.\n",
      "“I have it,” he said at last. “It was not the Wagon Lit murderer who tampered with the watch!\n",
      "It was the person we have called the Second Murderer—the left-handed person—in other words\n",
      "the woman in the scarlet kimono. She arrives later and moves back the hands of the watch in\n",
      "order to make an alibi for herself.”\n",
      "“Bravo said Dr. Constantine. “It is well imagined, that.”\n",
      "“In fact,” said Poirot, “she stabbed him in the dark, not realizing that he was dead already, but\n",
      "somehow deduced that he had a watch in his pyjama pocket, took it out, put back the hands\n",
      "blindly, and gave it the requisite dent.”\n",
      "M. Bouc looked at him coldly. “Have you anything better to suggest, yourself?” he asked. “At\n",
      "the moment—no,” admitted Poirot. “All the same,” he went on, “I do not think you have either\n",
      "of you appreciated the most interesting point about that watch.”\n",
      "“Does question No. 6 deal with it?” asked the doctor. “To that question—Was the murder\n",
      "committed at that time, 1.15?—I answer No.”\n",
      "“I agree,” said M. Bouc. “’Was it earlier?’ is the next question. I say—Yes! You, too,\n",
      "doctor?”\n",
      "The doctor nodded. “Yes, but the question ‘Was it later?’ can also be answered in the\n",
      "affirmative. I agree with your theory, M. Bouc, and so, I think, does M. Poirot, although he does\n",
      "not wish to commit himself. The First Murderer came earlier than 1. 15, but the Second\n",
      "Murderer came after 1.15. And as regards the question of left-handedness, ought we not to take\n",
      "steps to ascertain which of the passengers is left-handed?”\n",
      "“I have not completely neglected that point,” said Poirot. “You may have noticed that I made\n",
      "each passenger write either a signature or an address. That is not conclusive, because some\n",
      "people do certain actions with the right hand and others with the left. Some write right-handed,\n",
      "107Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "but play golf left-handed. Still, it is something. Every person questioned took the pen in his or\n",
      "her right hand—with the exception of Princess Dragomiroff, who refused to write.”\n",
      "“Princess Dragomiroff—impossible,” said M. Bouc.\n",
      "“I doubt if she would have had the strength to inflict that left-handed blow,” said Dr.\n",
      "Constantine dubiously. ‘That particular wound had been inflicted with considerable force.”\n",
      "“More force than a woman could use?”\n",
      "“No, I would not say that. But I think more force than an elderly woman could display, and\n",
      "Princess Dragomiroff’s physique is particularly frail.”\n",
      "“It might be a question of the influence of mind over body,” said Poirot. “Princess\n",
      "Dragomiroff has great personality and immense will-power. But let us pass from that for the\n",
      "moment.”\n",
      "“To questions Nos. 9 and 10? Can we be sure that Ratchett was stabbed by more than one\n",
      "person, and what other explanation of the wounds can there be? In my opinion, medically\n",
      "speaking, there can be no other explanation of those wounds. To suggest that one man struck\n",
      "first feebly and then with violence, first with the right hand and then with the left, and after an\n",

      "M. Bouc’s thoughts had run something as follows:\n",
      "“Assuredly I must think. But as far as that goes I have already thought. ... Poirot obviously\n",
      "thinks that this English girl is mixed up in the matter. I cannot help feeling that that is most\n",
      "unlikely. ... The English are extremely cold. Probably it is because they have no figures. ... But\n",
      "that is not the point. It seems that the Italian could not have done it—a pity. I suppose the\n",
      "English valet is not lying when he said the other never left the compartment? But why should he!\n",
      "It is not easy to bribe the English; they are so unapproachable. The whole thing is most\n",

      "“I would like first to mention certain points which appear to me suggestive. Let us start with a\n",
      "remark made to me by M. Bouc in this very place on the occasion of our first lunch together on\n",
      "the train. He commented on the fact that we were surrounded by people of all classes, of all ages,\n",
      "of all nationalities. That is a fact somewhat rare at this time of year. The Athens-Paris and the\n",
      "Bucharest-Paris coaches, for instance, are almost empty. Remember also, the passenger who\n",
      "failed to turn up. He is, I think, significant. Then there are some minor points that strike me as\n",
      "suggestive—for instance, the position of Mrs. Hubbard’s sponge-bag, the name of Mrs.\n",
      "Armstrong’s mother, the detective methods of M. Hardman, the suggestion of M. MacQueen that\n",
      "Ratchett himself destroyed the charred note we found, Princess Dragomiroff’s Christian name,\n",
      "and a grease spot on a Hungarian passport.”\n",
      "The two men stared at him.\n",
      "“Do they suggest anything to you, those points?” asked Poirot.\n",
      "“Not a thing,” said M. Bouc frankly.\n",
      "“And M. le docteur?”\n",
      "“I do not understand in the least what you are talking of.”\n",
      "M. Bouc, meanwhile, seizing upon the one tangible thing his friend had mentioned, was\n",
      "sorting through the passports. With a grunt he picked up that of Count and Countess Andrenyi\n",
      "and opened it.\n",
      "“Is this what you mean? This dirty mark?”\n",
      "“Yes. It is a fairly fresh grease spot. You notice where it occurs?”\n",
      "“At the beginning of the description of the Count’s wife—her Christian name, to be exact. But\n",

      "“I am going to approach it from another angle. Let us go back to the handkerchief found at the\n",

      "Hubbard, Miss Debenham and the maid, Hildegarde Schmidt. Now let us regard that\n",
      "handkerchief from another point of view. It is, my friends, an extremely expensive\n",
      "handkerchief—an objet de luxe, hand-made, embroidered in Paris. Which of the passengers,\n",

      "Englishwoman has a dainty linen handkerchief, not an expensive wisp of cambric costing\n",
      "perhaps two hundred francs. And certainly not the maid. But there are two women on the tram\n",

      "“Me, then. Her Christian name on her passport is disfigured by a blob of grease. just an\n",

      "Elena, it were Helena. That capital H could be turned into a capital E and then run over the small\n",

      "police. The threatening letters would have been produced by M. MacQueen; M. Hardman would\n",
      "have told his story; Mrs. Hubbard would have been eager to tell how a man passed through her\n",
      "compartment; the button would have been found. I imagine that two things only would have been\n",
      "different. The man would have passed through Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment just before one\n",
      "o’clock—and the Wagon Lit uniform would have been found cast off in one of the toilets.”\n",
      "“You mean?”\n",
      "“I mean that the murder was planned to look like an outside job. It would have been presumed\n",
      "that the assassin had left the train at Brod where it is timed to arrive at 0.58. Somebody would\n",
      "probably have passed a strange Wagon Lit conductor in the corridor. The uniform would be left\n",
      "in a conspicuous place so as to show clearly just how the trick had been played. No suspicion\n",
      "would have attached to the passengers. That, my friends, was how the affair was intended to\n",

      "“But the accident to the train changes everything. Doubtless we have here the reason why the\n",
      "man remained in the compartment with his victim so long. He was waiting for the train to go on.\n",
      "But at last he realised that the train was not going on. Different plans would have to be made.\n",

      "“Now we come to the other two clues that we found. I pass over the pipe-cleaner. We have\n",

      "unwittingly by that person.”\n",
      "“Exactly,” said Dr. Constantine. “She finds out that she has dropped the handkerchief and\n",

      "young sister of Mrs. Armstrong’s, little more than a child at the time of the tragedy, was Helena\n",

      "on. I will run over the points that remain. The first and most important is a remark made to me by\n",
      "131Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "M. Bouc in the restaurant car at lunch on the first day after leaving Stamboul—to the effect that\n",
      "the company assembled was interesting because it was so varied—representing as it did all\n",
      "classes and nationalities.\n",
      "“I agreed with him, but when this particular point came into my mind, I tried to imagine\n",
      "whether such an assembly was ever likely to be collected under any other conditions. And the\n",
      "answer I made to myself was—only in America. In America there might be a household\n",
      "composed of just such varied nationalities—an Italian chauffeur, an English governess, a\n",
      "Swedish nurse, a German lady’s-maid, and so on. That led me to my scheme of ‘guessing’—that\n",
      "is, casting each person for a certain part in the Armstrong drama much as a producer casts a play.\n",
      "Well, that gave me an extremely interesting and satisfactory result.\n",
      "“I had also examined in my own mind each separate person’s evidence, with some curious\n",
      "results. Take first the evidence of Mr. MacQueen. My first interview with him was entirely\n",
      "satisfactory. But in my second he made rather a curious remark. I had described to him the\n",
      "finding of a note mentioning the Armstrong case. He said, ‘But surely—’ and then paused and\n",
      "went on, ‘I mean—that was rather careless of the old man.’\n",
      "“Now I could feel that that was not what he had started out to say. Supposing what he had\n",
      "meant to say was ‘But surely that was burnt!’ In which case, MacQueen knew of the note and of\n",
      "its destruction—in other words, he was either the murderer or an accomplice of the murderer.\n",
      "Very good.\n",
      "“Then the valet. He said his master was in the habit of taking a sleeping draught when\n",
      "travelling by train. That might be true, but would Ratchett have taken one last night? The\n",
      "automatic under his pillow gave the lie to that statement. Ratchett intended to be on the alert last\n",
      "night. Whatever narcotic was administered to him must have been given without his knowledge.\n",
      "By whom? Obviously by MacQueen or the valet.\n",
      "“Now we come to the evidence of Mr. Hardman. I believed all that he told me about his own\n",
      "identity, but when it came to the actual methods he had employed to guard Mr. Ratchett, his\n",
      "story was neither more nor less than absurd. The only way to have protected Ratchett effectively\n",
      "was to pass the night actually in his compartment or in some spot where he could watch the door.\n",
      "The one thing that his evidence did show plainly was that no one in any other part of the train\n",
      "could possibly have murdered Ratchett. It drew a clear circle round the Stamboul-Calais\n",
      "carriage. That seemed to me a rather curious and inexplicable fact, and I put it aside to think\n",
      "over.\n",
      "“You probably all know by now of the few words I overheard between Miss Debenham and\n",
      "Colonel Arbuthnot. The interesting thing to my mind was the fact that Colonel Arbuthnot called\n",
      "her Mary and was clearly on terms of intimacy with her. But the Colonel was supposed to have\n",
      "met her only a few days previously. And I know Englishmen of the Colonel’s type—even if he\n",
      "had fallen in love with the young lady at first sight, he would have advanced slowly and with\n",
      "decorum, not rushing things. Therefore I concluded that Colonel Arbuthnot and Miss Debenham\n",
      "were in reality well acquainted and were for some reason pretending to be strangers. Another\n",
      "small point was Miss Debenham’s easy familiarity with the term ‘long distance’ for a telephone\n",

      "for her. Now—though her statement would have been perfectly true if she had been occupying\n",

      "that Mrs. Hubbard was inventing an incident that had never occurred.\n",
      "“And here let me say just a word or two about times. To my mind the really interesting point\n",
      "about the dented watch, is the place where it was found—in Ratchett’s pyjama pocket, a\n",
      "singularly uncomfortable and unlikely place to keep one’s watch, especially as there is a watch\n",
      "‘hook’ provided just by the head of the bed. I felt sure, therefore, that the watch had been\n",
      "deliberately placed in the pocket—faked. The crime, then, was not committed at a quarter past\n",
      "one.\n",
      "“Was it then committed earlier? To be exact, at twenty-three minutes to one? My friend M.\n",
      "Bouc advanced as an argument in favour of it the loud cry which awoke me from sleep. But if\n",

      "out, he would have been capable of making some kind of struggle to defend himself, and there\n",
      "were no signs of any such struggle.\n",
      "“I remembered that MacQueen had called attention, not once but twice (and the second time\n",
      "in a very blatant manner), to the fact that Ratchett could speak no French. I came to the\n",
      "conclusion that the whole business at twenty-three minutes to one was a comedy played for my\n",
      "benefit! Anyone might see through the watch business—it is a common enough device in\n",
      "detective stories. They assumed that I should see through it and that, pluming myself on my own\n",
      "cleverness, I would go on to assume that since Ratchett spoke no French, the voice I heard at\n",
      "twenty-three minutes to one could not have been his, and that Ratchett must have been already\n",
      "dead. But I am convinced that at twenty-three minutes to one Ratchett was still lying in his\n",

      "the French phrase used. If I am so unbelievably dense as not to realise the significance of that\n",
      "phrase, it must be brought to my attention. If necessary, MacQueen can come right out in the\n",
      "open. He can say, ‘Excuse me, M. Poirot, that can’t have been Mr. Ratchett speaking. He\n",

      "“I was particularly struck by the extraordinary difficulty of proving a case against any one\n",
      "person on the train, and by the rather curious coincidence that in each case the testimony giving\n",
      "an alibi came from what I might describe as an ‘unlikely’ person. Thus, Mr. MacQueen and\n",
      "Colonel Arbuthnot provided alibis for each other—two persons between whom it seemed most\n",
      "unlikely there should have been any prior acquaintanceship. The same thing happened with the\n",
      "English valet and the Italian, and with the Swedish lady and the English girl. I said to myself:\n",
      "This is extraordinary—they cannot all be in it!\n",
      "“And then, Messieurs, I saw light. They were all in it. For so many people connected with the\n",
      "Armstrong case to be travelling by the same train through coincidence was not only unlikely: it\n",
      "was impossible. It must be not chance, but design. I remembered a remark of Colonel\n",
      "Arbuthnot’s about trial by jury. A jury is composed of twelve people—there were twelve\n",
      "passengers—Ratchett was stabbed twelve times. And the thing that had worried me all along—\n",
      "133Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "the extraordinary crowd travelling in the Stamboul-Calais coach at a slack time of year—this was\n",
      "explained.\n",
      "“Ratchett had escaped justice in America. There was no question as to his guilt. I visualised a\n",
      "self-appointed jury of twelve people who had condemned him to death and who by the\n",
      "exigencies of the case had themselves been forced to be his executioners. And immediately, on\n",
      "that assumption, the whole case fell into beautiful shining order.\n",
      "“I saw it as a perfect mosaic, each person playing his or her allotted part. It was so arranged\n",
      "that, if suspicion should fall on any one person, the evidence of one or more of the others would\n",
      "clear the accused person and confuse the issue. Hardman’s evidence was necessary in case some\n",
      "outsider should be suspected of the crime and be unable to prove an alibi. The passengers in the\n",
      "Stamboul carriage were in no danger. Every minute detail of their evidence was worked out\n",
      "beforehand. The whole thing was a very cleverly planned jigsaw puzzle, so arranged that every\n",
      "fresh piece of knowledge that came to light made the solution of the whole more difficult. As my\n",
      "friend M. Bouc remarked, the case seemed fantastically impossible! That was exactly the\n",
      "impression intended to be conveyed.\n",
      "“Did this solution explain everything? Yes, it did. The nature of the wounds—each inflicted\n",
      "by a different person. The artificial threatening letters—artificial since they were unreal, written\n",
      "only to be produced as evidence. (Doubtless there were real letters, warning Ratchett of his fate,\n",
      "which MacQueen destroyed, substituting for them these others.) Then Hardman’s story of being\n",
      "called in by Ratchett—a lie, of course, from beginning to end. The description of the mythical\n",
      "‘small dark man with a womanish voice’—a convenient description since it had the merit of not\n",
      "incriminating any of the actual Wagon Lit conductors and would apply equally well to a man or\n",
      "a woman.\n",
      "“The idea of stabbing is at first sight a curious one, but on reflection nothing else would fit the\n",
      "circumstances so well. A dagger was a weapon that could be used by everyone—strong or\n",
      "weak—and it made no noise. I fancy, though I may be wrong, that each person in turn entered\n",
      "Ratchett’s darkened compartment through that of Mrs. Hubbard—and struck! They themselves\n",
      "would never know which blow actually killed him.\n",
      "“The final letter which Ratchett had probably found on his pillow was carefully burnt. With\n",
      "no clue pointing to the Armstrong case there would be absolutely no reason for suspecting any of\n",
      "the passengers on the train. It would be put down as an outside job, and the ‘small dark man with\n",
      "the womanish voice’ would actually have been seen by one or more of the passengers leaving the\n",
      "train, at Brod!\n",
      "“I do not know exactly what happened when the conspirators discovered that this part of their\n",
      "plan was impossible owing to the accident to the train. There was, I imagine, a hasty\n",
      "consultation, and then they decided to go through with it. It was true that now one and all of the\n",
      "passengers were bound to come under suspicion, but that possibility had already been foreseen\n",
      "and provided for. The only additional thing to be done was to confuse the issue even further.\n",
      "Two so-called ‘clues’ were dropped in the dead man’s compartment—one incriminating Colonel\n",
      "Arbuthnot (who had the strongest alibi and whose connection with the Armstrong family was\n",
      "probably the hardest to prove); and the second clue, the handkerchief, incriminating Princess\n",
      "Dragomiroff who, by virtue of her social position, her particularly frail physique and the alibi\n",
      "given her by her maid and the conductor, was practically in an unassailable position.\n",
      "“Further to confuse the issue, a red herring was drawn across the trail—the mythical woman\n",
      "in the red kimono. Again I am to bear witness to this woman’s existence. There is a heavy bang\n",
      "at my door. I get up and look out—and see the scarlet kimono disappearing in the distance. A\n",
      "134Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "judicious selection of people—the conductor, Miss Debenham and MacQueen—will also have\n",
      "seen her. It was, I think, someone with a sense of humour who thoughtfully placed the scarlet\n",
      "kimono on the top of my suitcase whilst I was interviewing people in the dining-car. Where the\n",
      "garment came from in the first place, I do not know. I suspect it is the property of Countess\n",
      "Andrenyi, since her luggage contained only a chiffon negligee so elaborate as to be rather a tea-\n",
      "gown than a dressing-gown.\n",
      "“When MacQueen first learned that the letter which had been so carefully burnt had in part\n",
      "escaped destruction, and that the word Armstrong was exactly the word remaining, he must at\n",
      "once have communicated his news, to the others. It was at this minute that the position of\n",
      "Countess Andrenyi became acute, and her husband immediately took steps to alter the passport.\n",
      "It was their second piece of bad luck!\n",
      "“They one and all agreed to deny utterly any connection with the Armstrong family. They\n",
      "knew I had no immediate means of finding out the truth, and they did not believe that I should go\n",
      "into the matter unless my suspicions were aroused against one particular person.\n",
      "“Now there was one further point to consider. Allowing that my theory of the crime was the\n",
      "correct one, and I believed that it must be the correct one, then obviously the Wagon Lit\n",
      "conductor himself must be privy to the plot. But if so, that gave us thirteen persons, not twelve.\n",
      "Instead of the usual formula ‘Of so many people one is guilty,’ I was faced with the problem that\n",
      "of thirteen persons one and one only was innocent. Which was that person?\n",
      "“I came to a very odd conclusion. I came to the conclusion that the person who had taken no\n",
      "part in the crime was the person who would be considered the most likely to do so. I refer to\n",
      "Countess Andrenyi. I was impressed by the earnestness of her husband when he swore to me\n",
      "solemnly on his honour that his wife never left her compartment that night. I decided that Count\n",
      "Andrenyi took, so to speak, his wife’s place.\n",
      "“If so, then Pierre Michel was definitely one of the twelve. But how could one explain his\n",
      "complicity? He was a decent man who had been many years in the employ of the company—not\n",
      "the kind of man who could be bribed to assist in a crime. Then Pierre Michel must be involved in\n",
      "the Armstrong case. But that seemed very improbable. Then I remembered that the dead nursery-\n",
      "maid had been French. Supposing that that unfortunate girl had been Pierre Michel’s daughter.\n",
      "That would explain everything—it would also explain the place chosen for the staging of the\n",
      "crime. Were there any others whose part in the drama was not clear? Colonel Arbuthnot I put\n",
      "down as a friend of the Armstrongs. They had probably been through the War together. The\n",
      "maid, Hildegarde Schmidt—I could guess her place in the Armstrong household. I am, perhaps,\n",
      "over greedy, but I sense a good cook instinctively. I laid a trap for her—she fell into it. I said I\n",
      "knew she was a good cook. She answered: ‘Yes, indeed, all my ladies have said so.’ But if you\n",
      "are employed as a lady’s-maid your employers seldom have a chance of learning whether or not\n",
      "you are a good cook.\n",
      "“Then there was Hardman. He seemed quite definitely not to belong to the Armstrong\n",
      "household. I could only imagine that he had been in love with the French girl. I spoke to him of\n",
      "the charm of foreign women—and again I obtained the reaction I was looking for. Sudden tears\n",
      "came into his eyes, which he pretended were dazzled by the snow.\n",
      "“There remains Mrs. Hubbard. Now Mrs. Hubbard, let me say, played the most important part\n",
      "in the drama. By occupying the compartment communicating with that of Ratchett she was more\n",
      "open to suspicion than anyone else. In the nature of things she could not have an alibi to fall back\n",
      "upon. To play the part she played—the perfectly natural, slightly ridiculous American fond\n",

      "He stopped.\n",
      "Then in a soft rich dreamy voice, quite unlike the one she had used throughout the journey,\n",
      "Mrs. Hubbard said:\n",
      "“I always fancied myself in comedy parts.”\n",
      "She went on, still dreamily:\n",
      "“That slip about the sponge-bag was silly. It shows that you should always rehearse property.\n",
      "We tried it on the way out—I was in an even-number compartment then, I suppose. I never\n",
      "thought of the bolts being in different places.”\n",
      "She shifted her position a little and looked straight at Poirot.\n",
      "“You know all about it, M. Poirot. You’re a very wonderful man. But even you can’t quite\n",
      "imagine what it was like—that awful day in New York. I was just crazy with grief; so were the\n",
      "servants. And Colonel Arbuthnot was there too. He was John Armstrong’s best friend.”\n",
      "“He saved my life in the War,” said Arbuthnot.\n",
      "“We decided then and there (perhaps we were mad—I don’t know) that the sentence of death\n",
      "that Cassetti had escaped had got to be carried out. There were twelve of us—or rather eleven;\n",
      "Susanne’s father was over in France, of course. First we thought we’d draw lots as to who should\n",
      "do it, but in the end we decided on this way. It was the chauffeur, Antonio, who suggested it.\n",
      "Mary worked out all the details later with Hector MacQueen. He’d always adored Sonia—my\n",
      "daughter—and it was he who explained to us exactly how Cassetti’s money had managed to get\n",
      "him off.\n",
      "“It took a long time to perfect our plan. We had first to track Ratchett down. Hardman\n",
      "managed that in the end. Then we had to try and get Masterman and Hector into his\n",
      "employment—or at any rate one of them. Well, we managed that. Then we had a consultation\n",
      "with Susanne’s father. Colonel Arbuthnot was very keen on having twelve of us. He seemed to\n",
      "think it made it more in order. He didn’t like the stabbing idea much, but he agreed that it did\n",
      "solve most of our difficulties. Well, Susanne’s father was willing. Susanne had been his only\n",
      "child. We knew from Hector that Ratchett would be coming back from the East sooner or later\n",
      "by the Orient Express. With Pierre Michel actually working on that train, the chance was too\n",
      "good to be missed. Besides, it would be a good way of not incriminating any outsiders.\n",
      "“My daughter’s husband had to know, of course, and he insisted on coming on the train with\n",
      "her. Hector wangled it so that Ratchett selected the right day for travelling, when Michel would\n",
      "be on duty. We meant to engage every carriage in the Stamboul-Calais coach, but unfortunately\n",
      "there was one carriage we couldn’t get. It had been reserved long beforehand for a director of the\n",
      "company. ‘Mr. Harris,’ of course, was a myth. But it would have been awkward to have any\n",
      "stranger in Hector’s compartment. And then, at the last minute, you came. ...”\n",
      "She stopped.\n",
      "“Well,” she said, “you know everything now, M. Poirot. What are you going to do about it? If\n",
      "it must all come out, can’t you lay the blame upon me and me only? I would have stabbed that\n",
      "man twelve times willingly. It wasn’t only that he was responsible for my daughter’s death and\n",
      "her child’s and that of the other child who might have been alive and happy now. It was more\n",
      "than that: there had been other children kidnapped before Daisy, and there might be others in the\n",
      "future. Society had condemned him—we were only carrying out the sentence. But it’s\n",
      "unnecessary to bring all these others into it. All these good faithful souls—and poor Michel-and\n",
      "Mary and Colonel Arbuthnot—they love each other. ...”\n",
      "136Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "Her voice was wonderful, echoing through the crowded space—that deep, emotional, heart-\n",
      "stirring voice that had thrilled many a New York audience.\n",
      "Poirot looked at his friend.\n",
      "“You are a director of the company, M. Bouc,” he said. “What do you say?”\n",

      "THE FACTS\n",
      "1\n",
      "AN IMPORTANT PASSENGER ON THE TAURUS EXPRESS\n",
      "It was five o’clock on a winter’s morning in Syria. Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the\n",
      "train grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express. It consisted of a kitchen and\n",
      "dining-car, a sleeping-car and two local coaches.\n",
      "By the step leading up into the sleeping-car stood a young French lieutenant, resplendent in\n",
      "uniform conversing, with a small man muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a\n",
      "pink-tipped nose and the two points of an upward-curled moustache.\n",
      "It was freezingly cold, and this job of seeing off a distinguished stranger was not one to be\n",
      "envied, but Lieutenant Dubosc performed his part manfully. Graceful phrases fell from his lips in\n",
      "polished French. Not that he knew what it was all about. There had been rumours, of course, as\n",
      "there always were in such cases. The General’s—his General’s—temper had grown worse and\n",
      "worse. And then there had come this Belgian stranger—all the way from England, it seemed.\n",
      "There had been a week—a week of curious tensity. And then certain things had happened. A\n",
      "very distinguished officer had committed suicide, another had suddenly resigned, anxious faces\n",
      "had suddenly lost their anxiety, certain military precautions were relaxed. And the General,\n",
      "Lieutenant Dubosc’s own particular General, had suddenly looked ten years younger.\n",
      "Dubosc had overheard part of a conversation between him and the stranger. “You have saved\n",
      "us, mon cher,” said the General emotionally, his great white moustache trembling as he spoke.\n",
      "“You have saved the honour of the French Army—you have averted much bloodshed! How can I\n",
      "thank you for acceding to my request? To have come so far—”\n",
      "To which the stranger (by name M. Hercule Poirot) had made a fitting reply including the\n",
      "phrase—“But indeed, do I not remember that once you saved my life?” And then the General\n",
      "had made another fitting reply to that, disclaiming any merit for that past service; and with more\n",
      "mention of France, of Belgium, of glory, of honour and of such kindred things they had\n",
      "embraced each other heartily and the conversation had ended.\n",
      "As to what it had all been about, Lieutenant Dubosc was still in the dark, but to him had been\n",
      "delegated the duty of seeing off M. Poirot by the Taurus Express, and he was carrying it out with\n",
      "all the zeal and ardour befitting a young officer with a promising career ahead of him.\n",
      "“To-day is Sunday,” said Lieutenant Dubosc. “Tomorrow, Monday evening, you will be in\n",
      "Stamboul.”\n",
      "It was not the first time he had made this observation. Conversations on the platform, before\n",
      "the departure of a train, are apt to be somewhat repetitive in character.\n",
      "“That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.\n",
      "7Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“And you intend to remain there a few days, I think?”\n",
      "“Mais oui. Stamboul, it is a city I have never visited. It would be a pity to pass through—\n",
      "comme ça.” He snapped his fingers descriptively. “Nothing presses—I shall remain there as a\n",
      "tourist for a few days.”\n",
      "“La Sainte Sophie, it is very fine,” said Lieutenant Dubosc, who had never seen it.\n",
      "A cold wind came whistling down the platform. Both men shivered. Lieutenant Dubosc\n",
      "managed to cast a surreptitious glance at his watch. Five minutes to five—only five minutes\n",
      "more!\n",
      "Fancying that the other man had noticed his glance, he hastened once more into speech.\n",
      "“There are few people travelling this time of year,” he said, glancing up at the windows of the\n",
      "sleeping-car above them.\n",
      "“That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.\n",
      "“Let us hope you will not be snowed up in the Taurus!”\n",
      "“That happens?”\n",
      "“It has occurred, yes. Not this year, as yet.”\n",
      "“Let us hope, then,” said M. Poirot. “The weather reports from Europe, they are bad.\n",
      "“Very bad. In the Balkans there is much snow.”\n",
      "“In Germany, too, I have heard.”\n",
      "“Eh bien,” said Lieutenant Dubosc hastily as another pause seemed to be about to occur.\n",
      "“Tomorrow evening at seven-forty you will be in Constantinople.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said M. Poirot, and went on desperately, “La Sainte Sophie, I have heard it is very\n",
      "fine.”\n",
      "“Magnificent, I believe.”\n",
      "Above their heads the blinds of one of the sleeping-car compartments was pushed aside and a\n",
      "young woman looked out.\n",
      "Mary Debenham had had little sleep since she left Baghdad on the preceding Thursday.\n",
      "Neither in the train to Kirkuk, nor in the Rest House at Mosul, nor last night on the train had she\n",
      "slept properly. Now, weary of lying wakeful in the hot stuffiness of her overheated compartment,\n",
      "she got up and peered out.\n",
      "This must be Aleppo. Nothing to see, of course. Just a long, poorly lighted platform with\n",
      "loud, furious altercations in Arabic going on somewhere. Two men below her window were\n",
      "talking French. One was a French officer, the other was a little man with enormous moustaches.\n",
      "She smiled faintly. She had never seen anyone quite so heavily muffled up. It must be very cold\n",
      "outside. That was why they heated the train so terribly. She tried to force the window down\n",
      "lower, but it would not go.\n",
      "The Wagon Lit conductor had come up to the two men. The train was about to depart, he said.\n",
      "Monsieur had better mount. The little man removed his hat. What an egg-shaped head he had! In\n",
      "spite of her preoccupations Mary Debenham smiled. A ridiculous-looking little man. The sort of\n",
      "little man one could never take seriously.\n",
      "Lieutenant Dubosc was saying his parting speech. He had thought it out beforehand and had\n",
      "kept it till the last minute. It was a very beautiful, polished speech.\n",
      "Not to be outdone, M. Poirot replied in kind. ...\n",
      "“En voiture, Monsieur,” said the Wagon Lit conductor. With an air of infinite reluctance M.\n",
      "Poirot climbed aboard the train. The conductor climbed after him. M. Poirot waved his hand.\n",
      "Lieutenant Dubosc came to the salute. The train, with a terrific jerk, moved slowly forward.\n",
      "“Enfin!” murmured M. Hercule Poirot.\n",
      "8Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“Brrrrrrrr,” said Lieutenant Dubosc, realising to the full how cold he was.\n",
      "“Voilà, Monsieur!” The conductor displayed to Poirot with a dramatic gesture the beauty of\n",
      "his sleeping compartment and the neat arrangement of his luggage. “The little valise of\n",
      "Monsieur, I have put it here.”\n",
      "His outstretched hand was suggestive. Hercule Poirot placed in it a folded note.\n",
      "“Merci, Monsieur.” The conductor became brisk and business-like. “I have the tickets of\n",
      "Monsieur. I will also take the passport, please. Monsieur breaks his journey in Stamboul, I\n",
      "understand?”\n",
      "M. Poirot assented. “There are not many people travelling, I imagine?” he said.\n",
      "“No, Monsieur. I have only two other passengers—both English. A Colonel from India and a\n",
      "young English lady from Baghdad. Monsieur requires anything?”\n",
      "Monsieur demanded a small bottle of Perrier.\n",
      "Five o’clock in the morning is an awkward time to board a train. There were still two hours\n",
      "before dawn. Conscious of an inadequate night’s sleep, and of a delicate mission successfully\n",
      "accomplished, M. Poirot curled up in a corner and fell asleep.\n",
      "When he awoke it was half-past nine he sallied forth to the restaurant car in search of hot\n",
      "coffee.\n",
      "There was only one occupant at the moment, obviously the young English lady referred to by\n",
      "the conductor. She was tall, slim and dark—perhaps twenty-eight years of age. There was a kind\n",
      "of cool efficiency in the way she was eating her breakfast and in the way she called to the\n",
      "attendant to bring her more coffee which bespoke a knowledge of the world and of travelling.\n",
      "She wore a dark-coloured travelling dress of some thin material eminently suitable for the heated\n",
      "atmosphere of the train.\n",
      "M. Hercule Poirot, having nothing better to do, amused himself by studying her without\n",
      "appearing to do so.\n",
      "She was, he judged, the kind of young woman who could take care of herself with perfect\n",
      "ease wherever she went. She had poise and efficiency. He rather liked the severe regularity of her\n",
      "features and the delicate pallor of her skin. He liked the burnished black head with its neat waves\n",

      "At lunch time the other two again shared a table and again they both completely ignored the\n",

      "talked of the Punjab and occasionally asked the girl a few questions about Baghdad where, it\n",
      "became clear, she had been in a post as governess. In the course of conversation they discovered\n",
      "some mutual friends, which had the immediate effect of making them more friendly and less\n",
      "stiff. They discussed old Tommy Somebody and old Reggie Someone Else. The Colonel\n",
      "inquired whether she was going straight through to England or whether she was stopping in\n",
      "Stamboul.\n",

      "“The train, it is as dangerous as a sea voyage!”\n",
      "Miss Debenham said evenly that that would be very nice. Her manner was slightly repressive.\n",
      "The Colonel, Hercule Poirot noticed, accompanied her back to her compartment. Later they\n",

      "“Yes?”\n",
      "“I wish I could enjoy it!”\n",
      "Arbuthnot did not answer. The square line of his jaw seemed a little sterner and grimmer.\n",
      "“I wish to Heaven you were out of all this,” he said.\n",
      "“Hush, please. Hush.”\n",
      "“Oh! it’s all right.” He shot a slightly annoyed glance in Poirot’s direction. Then he went on:\n",

      "“Oh! you mustn’t think that. The downtrodden governess is quite an exploded myth. I can\n",
      "assure you that it’s the parents who are afraid of being bullied by me.”\n",
      "They said no more. Arbuthnot was, perhaps, ashamed of his outburst.\n",

      "encasing his neat boots in goloshes. Thus attired, he descended gingerly to the platform and\n",
      "began to pace its length. He walked out beyond the engine.\n",
      "It was the voices which gave him the clue to the two indistinct figures standing in the shadow\n",

      "He would hardly have recognised the cool, efficient voice of Miss Debenham. ...\n",
      "“Curious,” he said to himself.\n",
      "The next day he wondered whether, perhaps, they had quarrelled. They spoke little to each\n",
      "other. The girl, he thought, looked anxious. There were dark circles under her eyes.\n",
      "It was about half-past two in the afternoon when the train came to a halt. Heads were poked\n",
      "out of windows. A little knot of men were clustered by the side of the line looking and pointing\n",
      "at something under the dining-car.\n",
      "Poirot leaned out and spoke to the Wagon Lit conductor who was hurrying past. The man\n",
      "answered, and Poirot drew back his head and, turning, almost collided with Mary Debenham\n",
      "who was standing just behind him.\n",
      "“What is the matter?” she asked rather breathlessly in French. “Why are we stopping?”\n",
      "“It is nothing, Mademoiselle. It is something that has caught fire under the dining-car.\n",
      "Nothing serious. It is put out. They are now repairing the damage. There is no danger, I assure\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "She made a little abrupt gesture, as though she were waving the idea of danger aside as\n",
      "something completely unimportant.\n",
      "“Yes, yes, I understand that. But the time!”\n",
      "“The time?”\n",
      "“Yes, this will delay us.”\n",
      "“It is possible—yes,” agreed Poirot.\n",
      "“But we can’t afford delay! This train is due in at 6.55, and one has to cross the Bosphorus\n",
      "and catch the Simplon Orient Express on the other side at nine o’clock. If there is an hour or two\n",
      "of delay we shall miss the connection.”\n",
      "“It is possible, yes,” he admitted.\n",
      "He looked at her curiously. The hand that held the window bar was not quite steady; her lips,\n",
      "too, were trembling.\n",
      "“Does it matter to you very much, Mademoiselle?” he asked.\n",
      "“Yes. Yes, it does. I—I must catch that train.”\n",
      "She turned away from him and went down the corridor to join Colonel Arbuthnot.\n",
      "Her anxiety, however, was needless. Ten minutes later the train started again. It arrived at\n",
      "Hayda-passar only five minutes late, having made up time on the journey.\n",
      "The Bosphorus was rough and M. Poirot did not enjoy the crossing. He was separated from\n",
      "his travelling companions on the boat and did not see them again.\n",
      "On arrival at the Galata Bridge he drove straight to the Tokatlian Hotel.\n",

      "long. The cold was bitter, and though the platform itself was protected, heavy snow was falling\n",

      "“Your valises have been moved, Monsieur. To the compartment No. 1, the compartment of\n",

      "each writing one letter of a word at a time. Also, the letters are printed. That makes the task of\n",
      "identifying the handwriting much more difficult.” He paused, then said: “Did you know that M.\n",
      "Ratchett had applied for help to me?”\n",
      "“To you?”\n",
      "MacQueen’s astonished tone told Poirot quite certainly that the young man had not known of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "The detective nodded. “Yes. He was alarmed. Tell me, how did he act when he received the\n",
      "first letter?”\n",
      "MacQueen hesitated.\n",
      "“It’s difficult to say. He—he—passed it off with a laugh in that quiet way of his. But\n",
      "somehow—” he gave a slight shiver—“I felt that there was a good deal going on underneath the\n",

      "Poirot nodded. Then he asked an unexpected question.\n",
      "“Mr. MacQueen, will you tell me, quite honestly, exactly how you regarded your employer?\n",
      "Did you like him?”\n",
      "Hector MacQueen took a moment or two before replying.\n",
      "31Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“No,” he said at last. “I did not.”\n",
      "“Why.”\n",
      "“I can’t exactly say. He was always quite pleasant in his manner.” He paused, then said: “I’ll\n",
      "tell you the truth, Mr. Poirot. I disliked and distrusted him. He was, I am sure, a cruel and\n",
      "dangerous man. I must admit, though, that I have no reasons to advance for my opinion.”\n",
      "“Thank you, Mr. MacQueen. One further question: when did you last see Mr. Ratchett alive?”\n",
      "“Last evening about—” he thought for a minute—“ten o’clock, I should say. I went into his\n",
      "compartment to take down some memoranda from him.”\n",
      "“On what subject?”\n",
      "“Some tiles and antique pottery that he bought in Persia. What had been delivered was not\n",
      "what he had purchased. There has been a long, vexatious correspondence on the subject.”\n",
      "“And that was the last time Mr. Ratchett was seen alive?”\n",
      "“Yes, I suppose so.”\n",
      "“Do you know when Mr. Ratchett received the last threatening letter?”\n",
      "“On the morning of the day we left Constantinople.”\n",
      "“There is one more question I must ask you, Mr. MacQueen. Were you on good terms with\n",
      "your employer?”\n",
      "The young man’s eyes twinkled suddenly.\n",
      "“This is where I’m supposed to go all goosefleshy down the back. In the words of a best\n",
      "seller, ‘You’ve nothing on me.’ Ratchett and I were on perfectly good terms.”\n",
      "“Perhaps, Mr. MacQueen, you will give me your full name and your address in America.”\n",
      "MacQueen gave his name—Hector Willard MacQueen—and an address in New York.\n",
      "Poirot leaned back against the cushions.\n",
      "“That is all for the present, Mr. MacQueen,” he said. “I should be obliged if you would keep\n",
      "the matter of Mr. Ratchett’s death to yourself for a little time.”\n",
      "“His valet, Masterman, will have to know.”\n",
      "“He probably knows already,” said Poirot drily. “If so, try to get him to hold his tongue.”\n",
      "“That oughtn’t to be difficult. He’s a Britisher and, as he calls it, he ‘keeps to himself.’ He has\n",
      "a low opinion of Americans, and no opinion at all of any other nationality.”\n",
      "“Thank you, Mr. MacQueen.”\n",
      "The American left the carriage.\n",
      "“Well?” demanded M. Bouc. “You believe what he says, this young man?”\n",
      "“He seems honest and straightforward. He did not pretend to any affection for his employer,\n",
      "as he probably would have done had he been involved in any way. It is true, Mr. Ratchett did not\n",
      "tell him that he had tried to enlist my services and failed, but I do not think that that is really a\n",
      "suspicious circumstance. I fancy Mr. Ratchett was a gentleman who kept his own counsel on\n",
      "every possible occasion.”\n",
      "“So you pronounce one person at least innocent of the crime,” said M. Bouc jovially.\n",
      "Poirot cast on him a look of reproach.\n",
      "“Me, I suspect everybody till the last minute,” he said. “All the same, I must admit that I\n",

      "fourteen times. It is not in accord with his psychology—not at all.”\n",
      "“No,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully. “That is the act of a man driven almost crazy with a\n",

      "THE BODY\n",
      "Followed by Dr. Constantine, Poirot made his way to the next coach and to the compartment\n",
      "occupied by the murdered man. The conductor came and unlocked the door for them with his\n",
      "key.\n",
      "The two men passed inside. Poirot turned inquiringly to his companion.\n",
      "“How much has been disarranged in this compartment?”\n",
      "“Nothing has been touched. I was careful not to move the body in making my examination.”\n",
      "Poirot nodded. He looked round him.\n",
      "The first thing that struck the senses was the intense cold. The window was pushed down as\n",
      "far as it would go, and the blind was drawn up.\n",
      "“Brrr,” observed Poirot.\n",
      "The other smiled appreciatively.\n",
      "“I did not like to close it,” he said.\n",
      "Poirot examined the window carefully.\n",
      "“You are right,” he announced. “Nobody left the carriage this way. Possibly the open window\n",
      "was intended to suggest that somebody did; but if so, the snow has defeated the murderer’s\n",
      "intention.”\n",
      "He examined the frame of the window carefully. Taking a small case from his pocket he blew\n",
      "a little powder over the frame.\n",
      "“No fingerprints at all,” he said. “That means it: has been wiped. Well, if there had been\n",
      "fingerprints they would have told us very little. They would have been those of Mr. Ratchett or\n",
      "his valet or the conductor. Criminals do not make mistakes of that kind nowadays.\n",
      "“And that being so,” he added cheerfully, “we might as well shut the window. Positively it is\n",
      "the cold storage in here!”\n",
      "He suited the action to the word and then turned his attention for the first time to the\n",
      "motionless figure lying in the bunk.\n",
      "Ratchett lay on his back. His pyjama jacket, stained with rusty patches, had been unbuttoned\n",
      "and thrown back.\n",
      "“I had to see the nature of the wounds, you see,” explained the doctor.\n",
      "Poirot nodded. He bent over the body. Finally he straightened himself with a slight grimace.\n",
      "“It is not pretty,” he said. “Someone must have stood there and stabbed him again and again.\n",
      "How many wounds are there exactly?”\n",
      "“I make it twelve. One or two are so slight as to be practically scratches. On the other hand, at\n",
      "least three would be capable of causing death.”\n",
      "Something in the doctor’s tone caught Poirot’s attention. He looked at him sharply. The little\n",
      "Greek was standing staring down at the body with a puzzled frown.\n",
      "“Something strikes you as odd, does it not?” he asked gently. “Speak, my friend. There is\n",
      "something here that puzzles you?”\n",
      "“You are right,” acknowledged the other.\n",
      "“What is it?”\n",
      "33Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“You see these two wounds—here and here—” He pointed. “They are deep. Each cut must\n",
      "have severed blood vessels—and yet the edges do not gape. They have not bled as one would\n",
      "have expected.”\n",
      "“Which suggests?”\n",
      "“That the man was already dead—some little time dead—when they were delivered. But that\n",
      "is surely absurd.”\n",
      "“It would seem so,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Unless our murderer figured to himself that he\n",
      "had not accomplished his job properly and came back to make quite sure—but that is manifestly\n",
      "absurd! Anything else?”\n",
      "“Well, just one thing.”\n",
      "“And that?”\n",
      "“You see this wound here—under the right arm—near the right shoulder. Take this pencil of\n",
      "mine. Could you deliver such a blow?”\n",
      "Poirot poised his hand.\n",
      "“Précisément,” he said. “I see. With the right hand it is exceedingly difficult, almost\n",
      "impossible. One would have to strike backhanded, as it were. But if the blow were struck with\n",
      "the left hand—”\n",
      "“Exactly, M. Poirot. That blow was almost certainly struck with the left hand.”\n",
      "“So that our murderer is left-handed? No, it is more difficult than that, is it not?”\n",
      "“As you say, M. Poirot. Some of these other blows are just as obviously right-handed.”\n",
      "“Two people. We are back at two people again,” murmured the detective. He asked abruptly:\n",
      "“Was the electric light on?”\n",
      "“It is difficult to say. You see, it is turned off by the conductor every morning about ten\n",
      "o’clock.”\n",
      "“The switches will tell us,” said Poirot.\n",
      "He examined the switch of the top light and also the roll-back bed-head light. The former was\n",
      "turned off. The latter was closed.\n",
      "“Eh bien,” he said thoughtfully. “We have here a hypothesis of the First and the Second\n",
      "Murderer, as the great Shakespeare would put it. The First Murderer stabbed his victim and left\n",
      "the compartment, turning off the light. The Second Murderer came in in the dark, did not see that\n",
      "his or her work had been done, and stabbed at least twice at a dead body. Que pensez-vous de\n",
      "ça?”\n",
      "“Magnificent!” said the little doctor with enthusiasm.\n",
      "The other’s eyes twinkled.\n",
      "“You think so? I am glad. It sounded to me a little like the nonsense.”\n",
      "“What other explanation can there be?”\n",
      "“That is just what I am asking myself. Have we here a coincidence, or what? Are there any\n",
      "other inconsistencies, such as would point to two people being concerned?”\n",
      "“I think I can say yes. Some of these blows, as I have already said, point to a weakness—a\n",
      "lack of strength or a lack of determination. They are feeble, glancing blows. But this one here—\n",
      "and this one—” Again he pointed. “Great strength was needed for those blows. They have\n",
      "penetrated the muscle.”\n",
      "“They were, in your opinion, delivered by a man?”\n",
      "“Most certainly.”\n",
      "“They could not have been delivered by a woman?”\n",
      "34Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“A young, vigorous, athletic woman might have struck them, especially if she were in the grip\n",
      "of a strong emotion; but it is in my opinion highly unlikely.”\n",
      "Poirot was silent a moment or two.\n",
      "The other asked anxiously, “You understand my point?”\n",
      "“Perfectly,” said Poirot. “The matter begins to clear itself up wonderfully! The murderer was\n",
      "a man of great strength—he was feeble—it was a woman—it was a right-handed person—it was\n",
      "a left-handed person. Ah! c’est rigolo, tout ça!” He spoke with sudden anger. “And the victim—\n",
      "what does he do in all this? Does he cry out? Does he struggle? Does he defend himself?”\n",
      "He slipped his hand under the pillow and drew out the automatic pistol which Ratchett had\n",
      "shown him the day before.\n",
      "“Fully loaded, you see,” he said.\n",
      "They looked round them. Ratchett’s day clothing was hanging from the hooks on the wall. On\n",
      "the small table formed by the lid of the wash basin were various objects. False teeth in a glass of\n",
      "water. Another glass, empty. A bottle of mineral water. A large flask. An ash-tray containing the\n",
      "butt of a cigar and some charred fragments of paper; also two burnt matches.\n",
      "The doctor picked up the empty glass and sniffed it.\n",
      "“Here is the explanation of the victim’s inertia,” he said quietly.\n",
      "“Drugged?”\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "Poirot nodded. He picked up the two matches and scrutinised them carefully.\n",
      "“You have a clue then?” demanded the little doctor eagerly.\n",
      "“Those two matches are of different shapes,” said Poirot. “One is flatter than the other. You\n",
      "see?”\n",
      "“It is the kind you get on the train,” said the doctor. “In paper covers.”\n",
      "Poirot was feeling in the pockets of Ratchett’s clothing. Presently he pulled out a box of\n",
      "matches. He compared them carefully with the burnt ones.\n",
      "“The rounder one is a match struck by Mr. Ratchett,” he said. “Let us see if he had also the\n",
      "flatter kind.”\n",
      "But a further search showed no other matches.\n",
      "Poirot’s eyes were darting about the compartment. They were bright and sharp like a bird’s.\n",
      "One felt that nothing could escape their scrutiny.\n",
      "With a little exclamation he bent and picked-up something from the floor.\n",
      "It was a small square of cambric, very dainty. In the corner was an embroidered initial—H.\n",
      "“A woman’s handkerchief,” said the doctor. “Our friend the chef de train was right. There is a\n",
      "woman concerned in this.”\n",
      "“And most conveniently she leaves her handkerchief behind!” said Poirot. “Exactly as it\n",
      "happens in the books and on the films—and to make things even easier for us, it is marked with\n",
      "an initial.”\n",
      "“What a stroke of luck for us!” exclaimed the doctor.\n",
      "“Is it not?” said Poirot.\n",
      "Something in his tone surprised the doctor, but before he could ask for elucidation Poirot had\n",
      "made another dive onto the floor.\n",
      "This time he held out on the palm of his hand—a pipe-cleaner.\n",
      "“It is perhaps the property of Mr. Ratchett?” suggested the doctor.\n",
      "“There was no pipe in any of his pockets, and no tobacco or tobacco pouch.”\n",
      "“Then it is a clue.”\n",
      "35Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "“Oh! decidedly. And again dropped most conveniently. A masculine clue, this time, you note!\n",
      "One cannot complain of having no clues in this case. There are clues here in abundance. By the\n",
      "way, what have you done with the weapon?”\n",
      "“There was no sign of any weapon. The murderer must have taken it away with him.”\n",
      "“I wonder why,” mused Poirot.\n",
      "“Ah!” The doctor had been delicately exploring the pyjama pockets of the dead man.\n",
      "“I overlooked this,” he said. “I unbuttoned the jacket and threw it straight back.”\n",
      "From the breast pocket he brought out a gold watch. The case was dented savagely, and the\n",
      "hands pointed to a quarter past one.\n",
      "“You see?” cried Constantine eagerly. “This gives us the hour of the crime. It agrees with my\n",
      "calculations. Between midnight and two in the morning is what I said, and probably about one\n",
      "o’clock, though it is difficult to be exact in these matters. Eh bien, here is confirmation. A\n",
      "quarter past one. That was the hour of the crime.”\n",
      "“It is possible, yes. It is certainly possible.”\n",
      "The doctor looked at him curiously. “You will pardon me, M. Poirot, but I do not quite\n",
      "understand you.”\n",
      "“I do not understand myself,” said Poirot. “I understand nothing at all. And, as you perceive,\n",
      "it worries me.”\n",
      "He sighed and bent over the little table examining the charred fragment of paper. He\n",
      "murmured to himself, “What I need at this moment is an old-fashioned woman’s hat-box.”\n",
      "Dr. Constantine was at a loss to know what to make of this singular remark. In any case Poirot\n",
      "gave him no time for questions. Opening the door into the corridor, he called for the conductor.\n",
      "The man arrived at a run.\n",
      "“How many women are there in this coach?”\n",
      "The conductor counted on his fingers.\n",
      "“One, two, three—six, Monsieur. The old American lady, a Swedish lady, the young English\n",
      "lady, the Countess Andrenyi, and Madame la Princesse Dragomiroff and her maid.”\n",
      "Poirot considered.\n",
      "“They all have hat-boxes, yes?”\n",
      "“Yes, Monsieur.”\n",
      "“Then bring me—let me see—yes, the Swedish lady’s and that of the lady’s-maid. Those two\n",
      "are the only hope. You will tell them it is a customs regulation—something—anything that\n",
      "occurs to you.”\n",
      "“That will be all right, Monsieur. Neither lady is in her compartment at the moment.”\n",
      "“Then be quick.”\n",
      "The conductor departed. He returned with the two hatboxes. Poirot opened that of the maid,\n",
      "and tossed it aside. Then he opened the Swedish lady’s and uttered an exclamation of\n",
      "satisfaction. Removing the hats carefully, he disclosed round humps of wire-netting.\n",
      "“Ah, here is what we need! About fifteen years ago hat-boxes were made like this. You\n",
      "skewered through the hat with a hatpin on to this hump of wire-netting.”\n",
      "As he spoke he was skillfully removing two of the attached humps. Then he repacked the hat-\n",
      "box and told the conductor to return both boxes where they belonged.\n",
      "When the door was shut once more he turned to his companion.\n",
      "“See you, my dear doctor, me, I am not one to rely upon the expert procedure. It is the\n",
      "psychology I seek, not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash. But in this case I would welcome a\n",
      "36Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "little scientific assistance. This compartment is full of clues, but can I be sure that those clues are\n",
      "really what they seem to be?”\n",
      "“I do not quite understand you, M. Poirot.”\n",
      "“Well, to give you an example—we find a woman’s handkerchief. Did a woman drop it? Or\n",
      "did a man, committing the crime, say to himself: ‘I will make this look like a woman’s crime. I\n",
      "will stab my enemy an unnecessary number of times, making some of the blows feeble and\n",
      "ineffective, and I will drop this handkerchief where no one can miss it’? That is one possibility.\n",
      "Then there is another. Did a woman kill him, and did she deliberately drop a pipe-cleaner to\n",
      "make it look like a man’s work? Or are we seriously to suppose that two people, a man and a\n",
      "woman, were separately concerned, and that each was so careless as to drop a clue to his or her\n",
      "identity? It is a little too much of a coincidence, that!”\n",
      "“But where does the hat-box come in?” asked the doctor, still puzzled.\n",
      "“Ah! I am coming to that. As I say, these clues—the watch stopped at a quarter past one, the\n",
      "handkerchief, the pipe-cleaner—they may be genuine, or they may be faked. As to that I cannot\n",
      "yet tell. But there is one clue here which—though again I may be wrong—I believe has not been\n",
      "faked. I mean this flat match, M. le docteur. I believe that that match was used by the murderer,\n",
      "not by Mr. Ratchett. It was used to burn an incriminating paper of some kind. Possibly a note. If\n",
      "so, there was something in that note, some mistake, some error, that left a possible clue to the\n",
      "assailant. I am going to try to discover what that something was.”\n",
      "He went out of the compartment and returned a few moments later with a small spirit stove\n",
      "and a pair of curling-tongs.\n",
      "“I use them for the moustaches,” he said, referring to the latter.\n",
      "The doctor watched him with great interest. Poirot flattened out the two humps of wire, and\n",
      "with great care wriggled the charred scrap of paper on to one of them. He clapped the other on\n",
      "top of it and then, holding both pieces together with the tongs, held the whole thing over the\n",
      "flame of the spirit-lamp.\n",
      "“It is a very makeshift affair, this,” he said over his shoulder. “Let us hope that it will answer\n",
      "our purpose.”\n",
      "The doctor watched the proceedings attentively. The metal began to glow. Suddenly he saw\n",
      "faint indications of letters. Words formed themselves slowly-words of fire.\n",
      "It was a very tiny scrap. Only three words and part of another showed.\n",
      "—member little Daisy Armstrong\n",
      "“Ah!” Poirot gave a sharp exclamation.\n",
      "“It tells you something?” asked the doctor.\n",
      "Poirot’s eyes were shining. He laid down the tongs carefully.\n",
      "“Yes,” he said. “I know the dead man’s real name. I know why he had to leave America.”\n",
      "“What was his name?”\n",
      "“Cassetti.”\n",
      "“Cassetti?” Constantine knitted his brows. “It brings back to me something. Some years ago. I\n",
      "cannot remember. ... It was a case in America, was it not?”\n",
      "“Yes,” said Poirot. “A case in America.”\n",
      "Further than that Poirot was not disposed to be communicative. He looked round him as he\n",
      "went on:\n",

      "“We will go into all that presently. Let us first make sure that we have seen all there is to be\n",

      "Quickly and deftly he went once more through the pockets of the dead man’s clothes but\n",
      "found nothing there of interest. He tried the communicating door which led through to the next\n",

      "“There is one thing that I do not understand,” said Dr. Constantine. “If the murderer did not\n",

      "“An excellent idea,” said Poirot.\n",
      "None of the three men was hungry, and the meal was soon eaten; but not till they were sipping\n",
      "their coffee did M. Bouc mention the subject that was occupying all their minds.\n",

      "Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti.”\n",
      "“I recall it now. A shocking affair—though I cannot remember the details.”\n",
      "“Colonel Armstrong was an Englishman—a V.C. He was half American, his mother having\n",
      "been a daughter of W. K. Van der Halt, the Wall Street millionaire. He married the daughter of\n",
      "Linda Arden, the most famous tragic American actress of her day. They lived in America and\n",
      "had one child—a girl whom they idolized. When she was three years old she was kidnapped, and\n",
      "an impossibly high sum demanded as the price of her return. I will not weary you with all the\n",
      "intricacies that followed. I will come to the moment when, after the parents had paid over the\n",
      "enormous sum of two hundred thousand dollars, the child’s dead body was discovered; it had\n",
      "been dead for at least a fortnight. Public indignation rose to fever point. And there was worse to\n",
      "follow. Mrs. Armstrong was expecting another baby. Following the shock of the discovery, she\n",
      "gave birth prematurely to a dead child, and herself died. Her broken-hearted husband shot\n",
      "himself.”\n",
      "“Mon Dieu, what a tragedy. I remember now,” said M. Bouc. “There was also another death,\n",
      "if I remember rightly?”\n",
      "“Yes, an unfortunate French or Swiss nursemaid. The police were convinced that she had\n",
      "some knowledge of the crime. They refused to believe her hysterical denials. Finally, in a fit of\n",
      "despair the poor girl threw herself from a window and was killed. It was proved afterwards that\n",
      "she had been absolutely innocent of any complicity in the crime.”\n",
      "“It is not good to think of,” said M. Bouc.\n",
      "“About six months later, this man Cassetti was arrested as the head of the gang who had\n",
      "kidnapped the child. They had used the same methods in the past. If the police seemed likely to\n",
      "get on their trail, they killed their prisoner, hid the body, and continued to extract as much money\n",
      "as possible before the crime was discovered.\n",
      "“Now, I will make clear to you this, my friend. Cassetti was the man! But by means of the\n",
      "enormous wealth he had piled up, and owing to the secret hold he had over various persons, he\n",
      "was acquitted on some technical inaccuracy. Notwithstanding that, he would have been lynched\n",
      "by the populace had he not been clever enough to give them the slip. It is now clear to me what\n",
      "39Agatha Christie (cid:153) MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n",
      "happened. He changed his name and left America. Since then he has been a gentleman of leisure,\n",
      "travelling abroad and living on his rentes.”\n",
      "“Ah! quel animal!” M. Bouc’s tone was redolent of heartfelt disgust. “I cannot regret that he\n",
      "is dead—not at all!”\n",
      "“I agree with you.”\n",
      "“Tout de même, it is not necessary that he should be killed on the Orient Express. There are\n",
      "other places.”\n",
      "Poirot smiled a little. He realised that M. Bouc was biased in the matter.\n",
      "“The question we have now to ask ourselves is this,” he said. “Is this murder the work of\n",
      "some rival gang whom Cassetti had double-crossed in the past, or is it an act of private\n",
      "vengeance?”\n",
      "He explained his discovery of the few words on the charred fragment of paper.\n",
      "“If I am right in my assumption, then, the letter was burnt by the murderer. Why? Because it\n",
      "mentioned the name ‘Armstrong,’ which is the clue to the mystery.”\n",
      "“Are there any members of the Armstrong family living?”\n",
      "“That, unfortunately, I do not know. I think I remember reading of a younger sister of Mrs.\n",

      "Poirot went on to relate the joint conclusions of himself and Dr. Constantine. M. Bouc\n",
      "brightened at the mention of the broken watch.\n",
      "“That seems to give us the time of the crime very exactly.”\n",
      "“Yes,” said Poirot. “It is very convenient.”\n",
      "There was an indescribable something in his tone that made both the other two look at him\n",
      "curiously.\n",
      "“You say that you yourself heard Ratchett speak to the conductor at twenty minutes to one?”\n",
      "asked M. Bouc.\n",

      "“Well,” said M. Bouc, “that proves at least that Cassetti—or Ratchett, as I shall continue to\n",

      "Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS. PART. I. THE. FACTS 1. AN. IMPORTANT. PASSENGER. ON. THE. TAURUS. EXPRESS. It was five o’clock on a winter’s morning in. Syria. Alongside the platform at. Aleppo stood the train grandly designated in railway guides as the. Taurus. Express. It consisted of a kitchen and dining-car, a sleeping-car and two local coaches. By the step leading up into the sleeping-car stood a young. French lieutenant, resplendent in uniform conversing, with a small man muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a pink-tipped nose and the two points of an upward-curled moustache. It was freezingly cold, and this job of seeing off a distinguished stranger was not one to be envied, but. Lieutenant. Dubosc performed his part manfully. Graceful phrases fell from his lips in polished. French. Not that he knew what it was all about. There had been rumours, of course, as there always were in such cases. The. General’s—his. General’s—temper had grown worse and worse. And then there had come this. Belgian stranger—all the way from. England, it seemed. There had been a week—a week of curious tensity. And then certain things had happened. A very distinguished officer had committed suicide, another had suddenly resigned, anxious faces had suddenly lost their anxiety, certain military precautions were relaxed. And the. General,. Lieutenant. Dubosc’s own particular. General, had suddenly looked ten years younger. Dubosc had overheard part of a conversation between him and the stranger. “You have saved us, mon cher,” said the. General emotionally, his great white moustache trembling as he spoke. “You have saved the honour of the. French. Army—you have averted much bloodshed! How can. I thank you for acceding to my request? To have come so far—”. To which the stranger (by name. M. Hercule. Poirot) had made a fitting reply including the phrase—“But indeed, do. I not remember that once you saved my life?”. And then the. General had made another fitting reply to that, disclaiming any merit for that past service; and with more mention of. France, of. Belgium, of glory, of honour and of such kindred things they had embraced each other heartily and the conversation had ended. As to what it had all been about,. Lieutenant. Dubosc was still in the dark, but to him had been delegated the duty of seeing off. M. Poirot by the. Taurus. Express, and he was carrying it out with all the zeal and ardour befitting a young officer with a promising career ahead of him. “To-day is. Sunday,” said. Lieutenant. Dubosc. “Tomorrow,. Monday evening, you will be in. Stamboul.”. It was not the first time he had made this observation. Conversations on the platform, before the departure of a train, are apt to be somewhat repetitive in character. “That is so,” agreed. M. Poirot. 7Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “And you intend to remain there a few days,. I think?” “Mais oui. Stamboul, it is a city. I have never visited. It would be a pity to pass through— comme ça.”. He snapped his fingers descriptively. “Nothing presses—I shall remain there as a tourist for a few days.” “La. Sainte. Sophie, it is very fine,” said. Lieutenant. Dubosc, who had never seen it. A cold wind came whistling down the platform. Both men shivered. Lieutenant. Dubosc managed to cast a surreptitious glance at his watch. Five minutes to five—only five minutes more! Fancying that the other man had noticed his glance, he hastened once more into speech. “There are few people travelling this time of year,” he said, glancing up at the windows of the sleeping-car above them. “That is so,” agreed. M. Poirot. “Let us hope you will not be snowed up in the. Taurus!” “That happens?” “It has occurred, yes. Not this year, as yet.” “Let us hope, then,” said. M. Poirot. “The weather reports from. Europe, they are bad. “Very bad. In the. Balkans there is much snow.” “In. Germany, too,. I have heard.” “Eh bien,” said. Lieutenant. Dubosc hastily as another pause seemed to be about to occur. “Tomorrow evening at seven-forty you will be in. Constantinople.” “Yes,” said. M. Poirot, and went on desperately, “La. Sainte. Sophie,. I have heard it is very fine.” “Magnificent,. I believe.”. Above their heads the blinds of one of the sleeping-car compartments was pushed aside and a young woman looked out. Mary. Debenham had had little sleep since she left. Baghdad on the preceding. Thursday. Neither in the train to. Kirkuk, nor in the. Rest. House at. Mosul, nor last night on the train had she slept properly. Now, weary of lying wakeful in the hot stuffiness of her overheated compartment, she got up and peered out. This must be. Aleppo. Nothing to see, of course. Just a long, poorly lighted platform with loud, furious altercations in. Arabic going on somewhere. Two men below her window were talking. French. One was a. French officer, the other was a little man with enormous moustaches. She smiled faintly. She had never seen anyone quite so heavily muffled up. It must be very cold outside. That was why they heated the train so terribly. She tried to force the window down lower, but it would not go. The. Wagon. Lit conductor had come up to the two men. The train was about to depart, he said. Monsieur had better mount. The little man removed his hat. What an egg-shaped head he had! In spite of her preoccupations. Mary. Debenham smiled. A ridiculous-looking little man. The sort of little man one could never take seriously. Lieutenant. Dubosc was saying his parting speech. He had thought it out beforehand and had kept it till the last minute. It was a very beautiful, polished speech. Not to be outdone,. M. Poirot replied in kind. ... “En voiture,. Monsieur,” said the. Wagon. Lit conductor. With an air of infinite reluctance. M. Poirot climbed aboard the train. The conductor climbed after him. M. Poirot waved his hand. Lieutenant. Dubosc came to the salute. The train, with a terrific jerk, moved slowly forward. “Enfin!” murmured. M. Hercule. Poirot. 8Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “Brrrrrrrr,” said. Lieutenant. Dubosc, realising to the full how cold he was. “Voilà,. Monsieur!”. The conductor displayed to. Poirot with a dramatic gesture the beauty of his sleeping compartment and the neat arrangement of his luggage. “The little valise of. Monsieur,. I have put it here.”. His outstretched hand was suggestive. Hercule. Poirot placed in it a folded note. “Merci,. Monsieur.”. The conductor became brisk and business-like. “I have the tickets of. Monsieur. I will also take the passport, please. Monsieur breaks his journey in. Stamboul,. I understand?”. M. Poirot assented. “There are not many people travelling,. I imagine?” he said. “No,. Monsieur. I have only two other passengers—both. English. A. Colonel from. India and a young. English lady from. Baghdad. Monsieur requires anything?”. Monsieur demanded a small bottle of. Perrier. Five o’clock in the morning is an awkward time to board a train. There were still two hours before dawn. Conscious of an inadequate night’s sleep, and of a delicate mission successfully accomplished,. M. Poirot curled up in a corner and fell asleep. When he awoke it was half-past nine he sallied forth to the restaurant car in search of hot coffee. There was only one occupant at the moment, obviously the young. English lady referred to by the conductor. She was tall, slim and dark—perhaps twenty-eight years of age. There was a kind of cool efficiency in the way she was eating her breakfast and in the way she called to the attendant to bring her more coffee which bespoke a knowledge of the world and of travelling. She wore a dark-coloured travelling dress of some thin material eminently suitable for the heated atmosphere of the train. M. Hercule. Poirot, having nothing better to do, amused himself by studying her without appearing to do so. She was, he judged, the kind of young woman who could take care of herself with perfect ease wherever she went. She had poise and efficiency. He rather liked the severe regularity of her features and the delicate pallor of her skin. He liked the burnished black head with its neat waves of hair, and her eyes—cool, impersonal and grey. But she was, he decided, just a little too efficient to be what he called “jolie femme.”. Presently another person entered the restaurant car. This was a tall man of between forty and fifty, lean of figure, brown of skin, with hair slightly grizzled round the temples. “The. Colonel from. India,” said. Poirot to himself. The newcomer gave a little bow to the girl. “Morning,. Miss. Debenham.” “Good morning,. Colonel. Arbuthnot.”. The. Colonel was standing with a hand on the chair opposite her. “Any objections?” he asked. “Of course not. Sit down.” “Well, you know, breakfast isn’t always a chatty meal.” “I should hope not. But. I don’t bite.”. The. Colonel sat down. “Boy,” he called in peremptory fashion. He gave an order for eggs and coffee. His eyes rested for a moment on. Hercule. Poirot, but they passed on indifferently. Poirot, reading the. English mind correctly, knew that he had said to himself. “Only some damned foreigner.” 9Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS. True to their nationality, the two. English people were not chatty. They exchanged a few brief remarks and presently the girl rose and went back to her compartment. At lunch time the other two again shared a table and again they both completely ignored the third passenger. Their conversation was more animated than at breakfast. Colonel. Arbuthnot talked of the. Punjab and occasionally asked the girl a few questions about. Baghdad where, it became clear, she had been in a post as governess. In the course of conversation they discovered some mutual friends, which had the immediate effect of making them more friendly and less stiff. They discussed old. Tommy. Somebody and old. Reggie. Someone. Else. The. Colonel inquired whether she was going straight through to. England or whether she was stopping in. Stamboul. “No,. I’m going straight on.” “Isn’t that rather a pity?” “I came out this way two years ago and spent three days in. Stamboul then.” “Oh! I see. Well,. I may say. I’m very glad you are going right through, because. I am.”. He made a kind of clumsy little bow, flushing a little as he did so. “He is susceptible, our. Colonel,” thought. Hercule. Poirot to himself with some amusement. “The train, it is as dangerous as a sea voyage!”. Miss. Debenham said evenly that that would be very nice. Her manner was slightly repressive. The. Colonel,. Hercule. Poirot noticed, accompanied her back to her compartment. Later they passed through the magnificent scenery of the. Taurus. As they looked down towards the. Cilician. Gates, standing in the corridor side by side, a sigh came suddenly from the girl. Poirot was standing near them and heard her murmur: “It’s so beautiful! I wish—I wish—” “Yes?” “I wish. I could enjoy it!”. Arbuthnot did not answer. The square line of his jaw seemed a little sterner and grimmer. “I wish to. Heaven you were out of all this,” he said. “Hush, please. Hush.” “Oh! it’s all right.”. He shot a slightly annoyed glance in. Poirot’s direction. Then he went on: “But. I don’t like the idea of your being a governess—at the beck and call of tyrannical mothers and their tiresome brats.”. She laughed with just a hint of uncontrol in the sound. “Oh! you mustn’t think that. The downtrodden governess is quite an exploded myth. I can assure you that it’s the parents who are afraid of being bullied by me.”. They said no more. Arbuthnot was, perhaps, ashamed of his outburst. “Rather an odd little comedy that. I watch here,” said. Poirot to himself thoughtfully. He was to remember that thought of his later. They arrived at. Konya that night about half-past eleven. The two. English travellers got out to stretch their legs, pacing up and down the snowy platform. M. Poirot was content to watch the teeming activity of the station through a window pane. After about ten minutes, however, he decided that a breath of air would not perhaps be a bad thing after all. He made careful preparations, wrapping himself in several coats and mufflers and encasing his neat boots in goloshes. Thus attired, he descended gingerly to the platform and began to pace its length. He walked out beyond the engine. It was the voices which gave him the clue to the two indistinct figures standing in the shadow of a traffic van. Arbuthnot was speaking. 10Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “Mary—”. The girl interrupted him. “Not now. Not now. When it’s all over. When it’s behind us—then—”. Discreetly. M. Poirot turned away. He wondered. ... He would hardly have recognised the cool, efficient voice of. Miss. Debenham. ... “Curious,” he said to himself. The next day he wondered whether, perhaps, they had quarrelled. They spoke little to each other. The girl, he thought, looked anxious. There were dark circles under her eyes. It was about half-past two in the afternoon when the train came to a halt. Heads were poked out of windows. A little knot of men were clustered by the side of the line looking and pointing at something under the dining-car. Poirot leaned out and spoke to the. Wagon. Lit conductor who was hurrying past. The man answered, and. Poirot drew back his head and, turning, almost collided with. Mary. Debenham who was standing just behind him. “What is the matter?” she asked rather breathlessly in. French. “Why are we stopping?” “It is nothing,. Mademoiselle. It is something that has caught fire under the dining-car. Nothing serious. It is put out. They are now repairing the damage. There is no danger,. I assure you.”. She made a little abrupt gesture, as though she were waving the idea of danger aside as something completely unimportant. “Yes, yes,. I understand that. But the time!” “The time?” “Yes, this will delay us.” “It is possible—yes,” agreed. Poirot. “But we can’t afford delay! This train is due in at 6.55, and one has to cross the. Bosphorus and catch the. Simplon. Orient. Express on the other side at nine o’clock. If there is an hour or two of delay we shall miss the connection.” “It is possible, yes,” he admitted. He looked at her curiously. The hand that held the window bar was not quite steady; her lips, too, were trembling. “Does it matter to you very much,. Mademoiselle?” he asked. “Yes. Yes, it does. I—I must catch that train.”. She turned away from him and went down the corridor to join. Colonel. Arbuthnot. Her anxiety, however, was needless. Ten minutes later the train started again. It arrived at. Hayda-passar only five minutes late, having made up time on the journey. The. Bosphorus was rough and. M. Poirot did not enjoy the crossing. He was separated from his travelling companions on the boat and did not see them again. On arrival at the. Galata. Bridge he drove straight to the. Tokatlian. Hotel. 11Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS 2. THE. TOKATLIAN. HOTEL. At the. Tokatlian,. Hercule. Poirot asked for a room with bath. Then he stepped over to the concierge’s desk and inquired for letters. There were three waiting for him and a telegram. His eyebrows rose a little at the sight of the telegram. It was unexpected. He opened it in his usual neat, unhurried fashion. The printed words stood out clearly. Development you predicted in. Kassner case has come unexpectedly. Please return immediately. “Voilà ce qui est embêtant,” muttered. Poirot vexedly. He glanced up at the clock. “I shall have to go on to-night,” he said to the concierge. “At what time does the. Simplon. Orient leave?” “At nine o’clock,. Monsieur.” “Can you get me a sleeper?” “Assuredly,. Monsieur. There is no difficulty this time of year. The trains are almost empty. First-class or second?” “First.” “Très bien,. Monsieur. How far are you going?” “To. London.” “Bien,. Monsieur. I will get you a ticket to. London and reserve your sleeping-car accommodation in the. Stamboul-Calais coach.”. Poirot glanced at the clock again. It was ten minutes to eight. “I have time to dine?” “But assuredly,. Monsieur.”. The little. Belgian nodded. He went over and cancelled his room order and crossed the hall to the restaurant. As he was giving his order to the waiter, a hand was placed on his shoulder. “Ah, mon vieux, but this is an unexpected pleasure!” said a voice behind him. The speaker was a short stout elderly man, his hair cut en brosse. He was smiling delightedly. Poiret sprang up. “M. Bouc!” “M. Poirot!”. M. Bouc was a. Belgian, a director of the. Compagnie. Internationale des. Wagons. Lits, and his acquaintance with the former star of the. Belgian police force dated back many years. “You find yourself far from home, mon cher,” said. M. Bouc. “A little affair in. Syria.” “Ah! and you return home—when?” “To-night.” “Splendid! I, too. That is to say,. I go as far as. Lausanne, where. I have affairs. You travel on the. Simplon. Orient,. I presume?” “Yes. I have just asked them to get me a sleeper. It was my intention to remain here some days, but. I have. received a telegram recalling me to. England on important business.” 12Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “Ah!” sighed. M. Bouc. “Les affaires—les affaires! But you, you are at the top of the tree nowadays, mon vieux!” “Some little success. I have had, perhaps.”. Hercule. Poirot tried to look modest but failed signally. M. Bouc laughed. “We will meet later,” he said. Hercule. Poirot addressed himself to the task of keeping his moustaches out of the soup. That difficult task accomplished, he glanced round him whilst waiting for the next course. There were only about half a dozen people in the restaurant, and of those half dozen there were only two that interested. Hercule. Poirot. These two sat at a table not far away. The younger was a likeable-looking young man of thirty, clearly an. American. It was, however, not he but his companion who had attracted the little detective’s attention. He was a man perhaps of between sixty and seventy. From a little distance he had the bland aspect of a philanthropist. His slightly bald head, his domed forehead, the smiling mouth that displayed a very white set of false teeth—all seemed to speak of a benevolent personality. Only the eyes belied this assumption. They were small, deep-set and crafty. Not only that. As the man, making some remark to his young companion, glanced across the room, his gaze stopped on. Poirot for a moment and just for that second there was a strange malevolence, an unnatural tensity in the glance. Then he rose. “Pay the bill,. Hector,” he said. His voice was slightly husky in tone. It had a queer, soft, dangerous quality. When. Poirot rejoined his friend in the lounge, the other two men were just leaving the hotel. Their luggage was being brought down. The younger was supervising the process. Presently he opened the glass door and said: “Quite ready now,. Mr. Ratchett.”. The elder man grunted an assent and passed out. “Eh bien,” said. Poirot. “What do you think of those two?” “They are. Americans,” said. M. Bouc. “Assuredly they are. Americans. I meant what did you think of their personalities?” “The young man seemed quite agreeable.” “And the other?” “To tell you the truth, my friend,. I did not care for him. He produced on me an unpleasant impression. And you?”. Hercule. Poirot was a moment in replying. “When he passed me in the restaurant,” he said at last, “I had a curious impression. It was as though a wild animal—an animal savage, but savage! you understand—had passed me by.” “And yet he looked altogether of the most respectable.” “Précisément! The body—the cage—is everything of the most respectable—but through the bars, the wild animal looks out.” “You are fanciful, mon vieux,” said. M. Bouc. “It may be so. But. I could not rid myself of the impression that evil had passed me by very close.” “That respectable. American gentleman?” “That respectable. American gentleman.” 13Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “Well,” said. M. Bouc cheerfully, “it may be so. There is much evil in the world.”. At that moment the door opened and the concierge came towards them. He looked concerned and apologetic. “It is extraordinary,. Monsieur,” he said to. Poirot. “There is not one first-class sleeping berth to be had on the train.” “Comment?” cried. M. Bouc. “At this time of year? Ah, without doubt there is some party of journalists—of politicians—?” “I don’t know, sir,” said the concierge, turning to him respectfully. “But that’s how it is.” “Well, well.”. M. Bouc turned to. Poirot. “Have no fear, my friend. We will arrange something. There is always one compartment, the. No. 16, which is not engaged. The conductor sees to that!”. He smiled, then glanced up at the clock. “Come,” he said, “it is time we started.”. At the station. M. Bouc was greeted with respectful empressement by the brown-uniformed. Wagon. Lit conductor. “Good evening,. Monsieur. Your compartment is the. No. 1.”. He called to the porters and they wheeled their load halfway along the carriage on which the tin plates proclaimed its destination:. ISTANBUL. TRIESTE. CALAIS “You are full up to-night,. I hear?” “It is incredible,. Monsieur. All the world elects to travel to-night!” “All the same you must find room for this gentleman here. He is a friend of mine. He can have the. No. 16.” “It is taken,. Monsieur.” “What? The. No. 16?”. A glance of understanding passed between them, and the conductor smiled. He was a tall sallow man of middle age. “But yes,. Monsieur. As. I told you, we are full—full—everywhere.” “But what passes itself?” demanded. M. Bouc angrily. “There is a conference somewhere? It is a party?” “No,. Monsieur. It is only chance. It just happens that many people have elected to travel to- night.”. M. Bouc made a clicking sound of annoyance. “At. Belgrade,” he said, “there will be the slip coach from. Athens. There will also be the. Bucharest-Paris coach. But we do not reach. Belgrade until to-morrow evening. The problem is for to-night. There is no second-class berth free?” “There is a second-class berth,. Monsieur—” “Well, then—” “But it is a lady’s berth. there is already a. German woman in the compartment—a lady’s maid.” “Là- là, that is awkward,” said. M. Bouc. “Do not distress yourself, my friend,” said. Poirot. “I must travel in an ordinary carriage.” “Not at all. Not at all.”. He turned once more to the conductor. “Everyone has arrived?” “It is true,” said the man, “that there is one passenger who has not yet arrived.”. He spoke slowly, with hesitation. “But speak then!” 14Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “No. 7 berth—a second-class. The gentleman has not yet come, and it is four minutes to nine.” “Who is it?” “An. Englishman,” the conductor consulted his list. “A. M. Harris.” “A name of good omen,” said. Poirot. “I read my. Dickens. M. Harris he will not arrive.” “Put. Monsieur’s luggage in. No. 7,” said. M. Bouc. “If this. M. Harris arrives we will tell him that he is too late—that berths cannot be retained so long—we will arrange the matter one way or another. What do. I care for a. M. Harris?” “As. Monsieur pleases,” said the conductor. He spoke to. Poirot’s porter, directing him where to go. Then he stood aside from the steps to let. Poirot enter the train. “Tout à fait au bout,. Monsieur,” he called. “The end compartment but one.”. Poirot passed along the corridor, a somewhat slow progress, since most of the people travelling were standing outside their carriages. His polite “Pardons” were uttered with the regularity of clockwork. At last he reached the compartment indicated. Inside it, reaching up to a suitcase, was the tall young. American of the. Tokatlian. He frowned as. Poirot entered. “Excuse me,” he said. “I think you’ve made a mistake.”. Then, laboriously in. French: “Je crois qua vous avez un erreur.”. Poirot replied in. English. “You are. Mr. Harris?” “No, my name is. MacQueen. I—”. But at that moment the voice of the. Wagon. Lit conductor spoke from over. Poirot’s shoulder—an apologetic, rather breathless voice. “There is no other berth on the train,. Monsieur. The gentleman has to come in here.”. He was hauling up the corridor window as he spoke and began to lift in. Poirot’s luggage. Poirot noticed the apology in his tone with some amusement. Doubtless the man had been promised a good tip if he could keep the compartment for the sole use of the other traveller. However, even the most munificent of tips lose their effect when a. Director of the. Company is on board and issues his orders. The conductor emerged from the compartment, having swung the suitcases up onto the racks. “Voilà,. Monsieur,” he said. “All is arranged. Yours is the upper berth, the. No. 7. We start in one minute.”. He hurried off down the corridor. Poirot re-entered the compartment. “A phenomenon. I have seldom seen,” he said cheerfully. “A. Wagon. Lit conductor himself puts up the luggage! It is unheard of!”. His fellow traveller smiled. He had evidently got over his annoyance—had probably decided that it was no good to take the matter otherwise than philosophically. “The train’s remarkably full,” he said. A whistle blew, there was a long melancholy cry from the engine. Both men stepped out into the corridor. Outside a voice shouted, “En voiture!” “We’re off,” said. MacQueen. But they were not quite off. The whistle blew again. “I say, sir,” said the young man suddenly. “If you’d rather have the lower berth—easier and all that—well, that’s all right by me.”. A likeable young fellow. “No, no,” protested. Poirot. “I would not deprive you—” 15Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “That’s all right—” “You are too amiable—”. Polite protests on both sides. “It is for one night only,” explained. Poirot. “At. Belgrade—” “Oh! I see. You’re getting out at. Belgrade—” “Not exactly. You see—”. There was a sudden jerk. Both men swung round to the window, looking out at the long lighted platform as it slid slowly past them. The. Orient. Express had started on its three-day journey across. Europe. 16Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS 3. POIROT. REFUSES. A. CASE. M. Hercule. Poirot was a little late in entering the luncheon-car on the following day. He had risen early, had breakfasted almost alone, and had spent the morning going over the notes of the case that was recalling him to. London. He had seen little of his travelling companion. M. Bouc, who was already seated, gated a greeting and summoned his friend to the empty place opposite him. Poirot sat down and soon found himself in the favoured position of being at the table which was served first and with the choicest morsels. The food, too, was unusually good. It was not till they were eating a delicate cream cheese that. M. Bouc allowed his attention to wander to matters other than nourishment. He was at the stage of a meal when one becomes philosophic. “Ah!” he sighed. “If. I had but the pen of a. Balzac! I would depict this scene.”. He waved a hand. “It is an idea, that,” said. Poirot. “Ah, you agree? It has not been done,. I think? And yet—it lends itself to romance, my friend. All around us are people, of all classes, of all nationalities, of all ages. For three days these people, these strangers to one another, are brought together. They sleep and eat under one roof, they cannot get away from each other. At the end of three days they part, they go their several ways, never perhaps to see each other again.” “And yet,” said. Poirot, “suppose an accident—” “Ah, no, my friend—” “From your point of view it would be regrettable,. I agree. But nevertheless let us just for one moment suppose it. Then, perhaps, all these here are linked together—by death.” “Some more wine,” said. M. Bouc, hastily pouring it out. “You are morbid, mon cher. It is, perhaps the digestion.” “It is true,” agreed. Poirot, “that the food in. Syria was not perhaps quite suited to my stomach.”. He sipped his wine. Then, leaning back, he ran his eye thoughtfully round the dining-car. There were thirteen people seated there and, as. M. Bouc had said, of all classes and nationalities. He began to study them. At the table opposite them were three men. They were, he guessed, single travellers graded and placed there by the unerring judgment of the restaurant attendants. A big swarthy. Italian was picking his teeth with gusto. Opposite him a spare neat. Englishman had the expressionless disapproving face of the well-trained servant. Next to the. Englishman was a big. American in a loud suit—possibly a commercial traveller. “You’ve got to put it over big,” he was saying in a loud, nasal voice. The. Italian removed his toothpick to gesticulate with it freely. “Sure,” he said. “That whatta. I say alla de time.”. The. Englishman looked out of the window and coughed. Poirot’s eye passed on. 17Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS. At a small table, sitting very upright, was one of the ugliest old ladies he had ever seen. It was an ugliness of distinction—it fascinated rather than repelled. She sat very upright. Round her neck was a collar of very large pearls which, improbable though it seemed, were real. Her hands were covered with rings. Her sable coat was pushed back on her shoulders. A very small and expensive black toque was hideously unbecoming to the yellow, toad-like face beneath it. She was speaking now to the restaurant attendant in a clear, courteous, but completely autocratic tone. “You will be sufficiently amiable to place in my compartment a bottle of mineral water and a large glass of orange juice. You will arrange that. I shall have chicken cooked without sauces for dinner this evening—also some boiled fish.”. The attendant replied respectfully that it should be done. She gave a slight gracious nod of the head and rose. Her glance caught. Poirot’s and swept over him with the nonchalance of the uninterested aristocrat. “That is. Princess. Dragomiroff,” said. M. Bouc in a low tone. “She is a. Russian. Her husband realised all his money before the. Revolution and invested it abroad. She is extremely rich. A cosmopolitan.”. Poirot nodded. He had heard of. Princess. Dragomiroff. “She is a personality,” said. M. Bouc. “Ugly as sin but she makes herself felt. You agree?”. Poirot agreed. At another of the large tables. Mary. Debenham was sitting with two other women. One of them was tall and middle-aged, in a plaid blouse and tweed skirt. She had a mass of faded yellow hair unbecomingly arranged in a large bun, wore glasses, and had a long mild amiable face rather like a sheep. She was listening to the third woman, a stout, pleasant-faced, elderly person who was talking in a slow clear monotone which showed no signs of pausing for breath or coming to a stop. “—and so my daughter said, ‘Why,’ she said, ‘you just can’t apply. American methods in this country. It’s natural to the folks here to be indolent,’ she said. ‘They just haven’t got any hustle in them—’. But all the same you’d be surprised to know what our college there is doing. They’ve got a fine staff of teachers. I guess there’s nothing like education. We’ve got to apply our. Western ideals and teach the. East to recognise them. My daughter says—”. The train plunged into a tunnel. The calm, monotonous voice was drowned. At the next table, a small one, sat. Colonel. Arbuthnot—alone. His gaze was fixed upon the back of. Mary. Debenham’s head. They were not sitting together. Yet it could easily have been managed. Why? Perhaps,. Poirot thought,. Mary. Debenham had demurred. A governess learns to be careful. Appearances are important. A girl with her living to get has to be discreet. His glance shifted to the other side of the carriage. At the far end, against the wall, was a middle-aged woman dressed in black with a broad, expressionless face. German or. Scandinavian, he thought. Probably the. German lady’s-maid. Beyond her were a couple leaning forward and talking animatedly together. The man wore. English clothes of loose tweed, but he was not. English. Though only the back of his head was visible to. Poirot, the shape of it and the set of the shoulders betrayed him. A big man, well made. He turned his head suddenly and. Poirot saw his profile. A very handsome man of thirty-odd with a big fair moustache. The woman opposite him was a mere girl—twenty at a guess. A tight-fitting little black coat and skirt, white satin blouse, small chic black toque perched at the fashionable outrageous angle. 18Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS. She had a beautiful foreign-looking face, dead white skin, large brown eyes, jet black hair. She was smoking a cigarette in a long holder. Her manicured hands had deep red nails. She wore one large emerald set in platinum. There was coquetry in her glance and voice. “Elle est jolie—et chic,” murmured. Poirot. “Husband and wife—eh?”. M. Bouc nodded. “Hungarian. Embassy,. I believe,” he said. “A handsome couple.”. There were only two more lunchers—Poirot’s fellow traveller. MacQueen and his employer. Mr. Ratchett. The latter sat facing. Poirot, and for the second time. Poirot studied that unprepossessing face, noting the false benevolence of the brow and the small, cruel eyes. Doubtless. M. Bouc saw a change in his friend’s expression. “It is at your wild animal you look?” he asked. Poirot nodded. As his coffee was brought to him,. M. Bouc rose to his feet. Having started before. Poirot he had finished some time ago. “I return to my compartment,” he said. “Come along presently and converse with me.” “With pleasure.”. Poirot sipped his coffee and ordered a liqueur. The attendant was passing from table to table with his box of money, accepting payment for bills. The elderly. American lady’s voice rose shrill and plaintive. “My daughter said: ‘Take a book of food tickets and you’ll have no trouble—no trouble at all.’. Now, that isn’t so. Seems they have to have a ten per cent tip, and then there’s that bottle of mineral water—and a queer sort of water too. They didn’t have any. Evian or. Vichy, which seems queer to me.” “It is—they must—how do you say?—serve the water of the country,” explained the sheep- faced lady. “Well, it seems queer to me.”. She looked distastefully at the heap of small change on the table in front of her. “Look at all this peculiar stuff he’s given me. Dinars or something. Just a lot of rubbish, it looks like! My daughter said—”. Mary. Debenham pushed back her chair and left with a slight bow to the other two. Colonel. Arbuthnot got up and followed her. Gathering up her despised money the. American woman followed suit, followed by the other one like a sheep. The. Hungarians had already departed. The restaurant car was empty save for. Poirot and. Ratchett and. MacQueen. Ratchett spoke to his companion, who got up and left the car. Then he rose himself, but instead of following. MacQueen he dropped unexpectedly into the seat opposite. Poirot. “Can you oblige me with a light?” he said. His voice was soft—faintly nasal. “My name is. Ratchett.”. Poirot bowed slightly. He slipped his hand into his pocket and produced a matchbox which he handed to the other man, who took it but did not strike a light. “I think,” he went on, “that. I have the pleasure of speaking to. Mr. Hercule. Poirot. Is that so?”. Poirot bowed again. “You have been correctly informed,. Monsieur.”. The detective was conscious of those strange shrewd eyes summing him up before the other spoke again. “In my country,” he said, “we come to the point quickly. Mr. Poirot,. I want you to take on a job for me.”. Hercule. Poirot’s eyebrows went up a trifle. “My clientèle,. Monsieur, is limited nowadays. I undertake very few cases.” 19Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “Why, naturally,. I understand that. But this,. Mr. Poirot, means big money.”. He repeated again in his soft, persuasive voice, “Big money.”. Hercule. Poirot was silent a minute or two. Then he said: “What is it you wish me to do for you,. Monsieur—er—Ratchett?” “Mr. Poirot,. I am a rich man—a very rich man. Men in that position have enemies. I have an enemy.” “Only one enemy?” “Just what do you mean by that question?” asked. Ratchett sharply. “Monsieur, in my experience when a man is in a position to have, as you say, enemies, then it does not usually resolve itself into one enemy only.”. Ratchett seemed relieved by—Poirot’s answer. He said quickly: “Why, yes,. I appreciate that point. Enemy or enemies—it doesn’t matter. What does matter is my safety.” “Safety?” “My life has been threatened,. Mr. Poirot. Now. I’m a man who can take pretty good care of himself.”. From the pocket of his coat his hand brought a small automatic into sight for a moment. He continued grimly. “I don’t think. I’m the kind of man to be caught napping. But, as. I look at it,. I might as well make assurance doubly sure. I fancy you’re the man for my money,. Mr. Poirot. And remember—big money.”. Poirot looked at him thoughtfully for some minutes. His face was completely expressionless. The other could have had no clue as to what thoughts were passing in that mind. “I regret,. Monsieur,” he said at length, “that. I cannot oblige you.”. The other looked at him shrewdly. “Name your figure, then,” he said. Poirot shook his head. “You do not understand,. Monsieur. I have been very fortunate in my profession. I have made enough money to satisfy both my needs and my caprices. I take now only such cases as—interest me.” “You’ve got a pretty good nerve,” said. Ratchett. “Will twenty thousand dollars tempt you?” “It will not.” “If you’re holding out for more, you won’t get it. I know what a thing’s worth to me.” “I, also,. M. Ratchett.” “What’s wrong with my proposition?”. Poirot rose. “If you will forgive me for being personal—I do not like your face,. M. Ratchett,” he said. And with that he left the restaurant car. 20Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS 4. A. CRY. IN. THE. NIGHT. The. Simplon. Orient. Express arrived at. Belgrade at a quarter to nine that evening. It was not due to depart again until 9.15, so. Poirot descended to the platform. He did not, however, remain there long. The cold was bitter, and though the platform itself was protected, heavy snow was falling outside. He returned to his compartment. The conductor, who was on the platform stamping his feet and waving his arms to keep warm, spoke to him. “Your valises have been moved,. Monsieur. To the compartment. No. 1, the compartment of. M. Bouc.” “But where is. Monsieur. Bouc, then?” “He has moved into the coach from. Athens which has just been put on.”. Poirot went in search of his friend. M. Bouc waved his protestations aside. “It is nothing. It is nothing. It is more convenient like this. You are going through to. England, so it is better that you should stay in the through coach to. Calais. Me,. I am very well here. It is most peaceful. This coach is empty save for myself and one little. Greek doctor. Ah! my friend, what a night! They say there has not been so much snow for years. Let us hope we shall not be held up. I am not too happy about it,. I can tell you.”. At 9.15 punctually the train pulled out of the station, and shortly afterwards. Poirot got up, said good night to his friend, and made his way along the corridor back into his own coach which was in front next to the dining-car. On this, the second day of the journey, barriers were breaking down. Colonel. Arbuthnot was standing at the door of his compartment talking to. MacQueen. When. MacQueen saw. Poirot he broke off something he was saying. He looked very much surprised. “Why,” he cried, “I thought you’d left us. You said you were getting off at. Belgrade.” “You misunderstood me,” said. Poirot, smiling. “I remember now, the train started from. Stamboul just as we were talking about it.” “But, man, your baggage. It’s gone.” “It has been moved into another compartment, that is all.” “Oh! I see.”. He resumed his conversation with. Arbuthnot, and. Poirot passed on down the corridor. Two doors from his own compartment, the elderly. American,. Mrs. Hubbard, was standing talking to the sheep-like lady, who was a. Swede. Mrs. Hubbard was pressing a magazine on the other. “No, do take it, my dear,” she said. “I’ve got plenty of other things to read. My, isn’t the cold something frightful?”. She nodded amicably to. Poirot. “You are most kind,” said the. Swedish lady. “Not at all. I hope you’ll sleep well and that your head will be better in the morning.” “It is the cold only. I make now myself a cup of tea.” “Have you got some aspirin? Are you sure now? I’ve got plenty. Well, good night, my dear.”. She turned to. Poirot conversationally as the other woman departed. 21Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “Poor creature, she’s a. Swede. As far as. I can make out she’s a kind of missionary. A teaching one. A nice creature, but doesn’t talk much. English. She was most interested in what. I told her about my daughter.”. Poirot, by now, knew all about. Mrs. Hubbard’s daughter. Everyone on the train who could understand. English did! How she and her husband were on the staff of a big. American college in. Smyrna, and how this was. Mrs. Hubbard’s first journey to the. East, and what she thought of the. Turks and their slipshod ways and the condition of their roads. The door next to them opened and the thin pale manservant stepped out. Inside,. Poirot caught a glimpse of. Mr. Ratchett sitting up in bed. He saw. Poirot and his face changed, darkening with anger. Then the door was shut. Mrs. Hubbard drew. Poirot a little wide. “You know,. I’m dead scared of that man. Oh! not the valet—the other. His master. Master, indeed! There’s something wrong about that man. My daughter always says. I’m very intuitive. ‘When. Mamma gets a hunch, she’s dead right,’ that’s what my daughter says. And. I’ve got a hunch about that man. He’s next door to me and. I don’t like it. I put my grips against the communicating door last night. I thought. I heard him trying the handle. Duo you know,. I shouldn’t be a bit surprised if that man turned out to be a murderer—one of these train robbers you read about. I daresay. I’m foolish, but there it is. I’m absolutely scared to death of the man! My daughter said. I’d have an easy journey, but somehow. I don’t feel happy about it. It may be foolish, but. I feel as if anything might happen—anything at all. And how that nice young fellow can bear to be his secretary,. I can’t think.”. Colonel. Arbuthnot and. MacQueen were coming towards them down the corridor. “Come into my carriage,”. MacQueen was saying. “It isn’t made up for the night yet. Now what. I want to get right about your policy in. India is this—”. The two men passed and went on down the corridor to. MacQueen’s carriage. Mrs. Hubbard said good night to. Poirot. “I guess. I’ll go right to bed and read,” she said. “Good night.” “Good night,. Madame.”. Poirot passed into his own compartment, which was the next one beyond. Ratchett’s. He undressed and got into bed, read for about half an hour and then turned out the light. He awoke some hours later, awoke with a start. He knew what it was that had wakened him— a loud groan, almost a cry, somewhere close at hand. At the same moment the ting of a bell sounded sharply. Poirot sat up and switched on the light. He noticed that the train was at a standstill— presumably at a station. That cry had startled him. He remembered that it was. Ratchett who had the next compartment. He got out of bed and opened the door just as the. Wagon. Lit conductor came hurrying along the corridor and knocked on. Ratchett’s door. Poirot kept his door open a crack and watched. The conductor tapped a second time. A bell rang and a light showed over another door farther down. The conductor glanced over his shoulder. At the same moment a voice from within the next compartment called out: “Ce n’est rien. Je me suis trompé.” “Bien,. Monsieur.”. The conductor scurried off again, to knock at the door where the light was showing. Poirot returned to bed, his mind relieved, and switched off the light. He glanced at his watch. It was just twenty-three minutes to one. 22Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS 5. THE. CRIME. He found it difficult to go to sleep again at once. For one thing he missed the motion of the train. If it was a station outside, it was curiously quiet. By contrast the noises on the train seemed unusually loud. He could hear. Ratchett moving about next door—a click as he pulled down the washbasin, the sound of the tap running, a splashing noise, then another click as the basin shut to again. Footsteps passed up the corridor outside, the shuffling footsteps of someone in bedroom slippers. Hercule. Poirot lay awake staring at the ceiling. Why was the station outside so silent? His throat felt dry. He had forgotten to ask for his usual bottle of mineral water. He looked at his watch again. Just after a quarter past one. He would ring for the conductor and ask for some mineral water. His finger went out to the bell, but he paused as in the stillness he heard a ting. The man couldn’t answer every bell at once. Ting. ... Ting. ... Ting. ... It sounded again and again. Where was the man? Somebody was getting impatient. Ti-i-i-ing! Whoever it was, was keeping a finger solidly on the push-button. Suddenly with a rush, his footsteps echoing up the aisle, the man came. He knocked at a door not far from. Poirot’s own. Then came voices—the conductor’s, deferential, apologetic; and a woman’s, insistent and voluble. Mrs. Hubbard! Poirot smiled to himself. The altercation—if it was one—went on for some time. Its proportions were ninety per cent of. Mrs. Hubbard’s to a soothing ten per cent of the conductor’s. Finally the matter seemed to be adjusted. Poirot heard distinctly a “Bonne nuit,. Madame,” and a closing door. He pressed his own finger on the bell. The conductor arrived promptly. He looked hot and worried. “De l’eau minérale, s’il vous. Plaît.” “Bien,. Monsieur.”. Perhaps a twinkle in. Poirot’s eye led him to unburden himself. “La dame américaine—” “Yes?”. He wiped his forehead. “Imagine to yourself the time. I have had with her! She insists—but insists—that there is a man in her compartment! Figure to yourself,. Monsieur. In a space of this size.”. He swept a hand round. “Where would he conceal himself? I argue with her. I point out that it is impossible. She insists. She woke up, and there was a man there. And how,. I ask, did he get out and leave the door bolted behind him? But she will not listen to reason. As though there were not enough to worry us already. This snow—” “Snow?” “But yes,. Monsieur. Monsieur has not noticed? The train has stopped. We have run into a snowdrift. Heaven knows how long we shall be here. I remember once being snowed up for seven days.” 23Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “Where are we?” “Between. Vincovci and. Brod.” “Là-là,” said. Poirot vexedly. The man withdrew and returned with the water. “Bon soir,. Monsieur.”. Poirot drank a glass of water and composed himself to sleep. He was just dropping off when something again woke him. This time it was as though something heavy had fallen with a thud against the door. He sprang up, opened it and looked out. Nothing. But to his right, some distance down the corridor, a woman wrapped in a scarlet kimono was retreating from him. At the other end, sitting on his little seat, the conductor was entering up figures on large sheets of paper. Everything was deathly quiet. “Decidedly. I suffer from the nerves,” said. Poirot and retired to bed again. This time he slept till morning. When he awoke the train was still at a standstill. He raised a blind and looked out. Heavy banks of snow surrounded the train. He glanced at his watch and saw that it was past nine o’clock. At a quarter to ten, neat, spruce and dandified as ever, he made his way to the restaurant car, where a chorus of woe was going on. Any barriers there might have been between the passengers had now quite broken down. All were united by a common misfortune. Mrs. Hubbard was loudest in her lamentations. “My daughter said it would be the easiest way in the world. Just sit in the train until. I got to. Parrus. And now we may be here for days and days,” she wailed. “And my boat sails day after to-morrow. How am. I going to catch it now? Why,. I can’t even wire to cancel my passage. I’m just too mad to talk about it!”. The. Italian said that he had urgent business himself in. Milan. The large. American said that that was “too bad,. Ma’am,” and soothingly expressed a hope that the train might make up time. “My sister—her children wait me,” said the. Swedish lady, and wept. “I get no word to them. What they think? They will say bad things have happen to me.” “How long shall we be here?” demanded. Mary. Debenham. “Doesn’t anybody know?”. Her voice sounded impatient, but. Poirot noted that there were no signs of that almost feverish anxiety which she had displayed during the check to the. Taurus. Express. Mrs. Hubbard was off again. “There isn’t anybody knows a thing on this train. And nobody’s trying to do anything. Just a pack of useless foreigners. Why, if this were at home, there’d be someone at least trying to do something!”. Arbuthnot turned to. Poirot and spoke in careful. British. French. “Vous êtes un directeur de la ligne, je crois,. Monsieur. Vous pouvez nous dire—”. Smiling,. Poirot corrected him. “No, no,” he said in. English. “It is not. I. You confound me with my friend,. M. Bouc.” “Oh,. I’m sorry” “Not at all. It is most natural. I am now in the compartment that he had formerly.”. M. Bouc was not present in the restaurant car. Poirot looked about to notice who else was absent. Princess. Dragomiroff was missing, and the. Hungarian couple. Also. Ratchett, his valet, and the. German lady’s-maid. 24Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS. The. Swedish lady wiped her eyes. “I am foolish,” she said. “I am bad to cry. All is for the best, whatever happen.”. This. Christian spirit, however, was far from being shared. “That’s all very well,” said. MacQueen restlessly. “We may be here for days.” “What is this country anyway?” demanded. Mrs. Hubbard tearfully. On being told it was. Jugo-Slavia, she said: “Oh! one of these. Balkan things. What can you expect?” “You are the only patient one,. Mademoiselle,” said. Poirot to. Miss. Debenham. She shrugged her shoulders slightly. “What can one do?” “You are a philosopher,. Mademoiselle.” “That implies a detached attitude. I think my attitude is more selfish. I have learned to save myself useless emotion.”. She was speaking more to herself than to him. She was not even looking at him. Her gaze went past him, out of the window to where the snow lay in heavy masses. “You are a strong character,. Mademoiselle,” said. Poirot gently. “You are,. I think, the strongest character amongst us.” “Oh! no. No, indeed. I know one far, far stronger than. I am.” “And that is—?”. She seemed suddenly to come to herself, to realise that she was talking to a stranger and foreigner, with whom, until this morning, she had exchanged only half a dozen sentences. She laughed, a polite but estranging laugh. “Well—that old lady, for instance. You have probably noticed her. A very ugly old lady but rather fascinating. She has only to lift a little finger and ask for something in a polite voice—and the whole train runs.” “It runs also for my friend. M. Bouc,” said. Poirot. “But that is because he is a director of the line, not because he has a strong character.”. Mary. Debenham smiled. The morning wore away. Several people,. Poirot amongst them, remained in the dining-car. The communal life was felt, at the moment, to pass the time better. He heard a good deal more about. Mrs. Hubbard’s daughter, and he heard the lifelong habits of. Mr. Hubbard, deceased, from his rising in the morning and commencing breakfast with a cereal to his final rest at night in the bed-socks that. Mrs. Hubbard herself had been in the habit of knitting for him. It was when he was listening to a confused account of the missionary aims of the. Swedish lady that one of the. Wagon. Lit conductors came into the car and stood at his elbow. “Pardon,. Monsieur.” “Yes?” “The compliments of. M. Bouc, and he would be glad if you would be so kind as to come to him for a few minutes.”. Poirot rose, uttered excuses to the. Swedish lady and followed the man out of the dining-car. It was not his own conductor, but a big fair man. He followed his guide down the corridor of his own carriage and along the corridor of the next one. The man tapped at a door, then stood aside to let. Poirot enter. The compartment was not. M. Bouc’s own. It was a second-class one—chosen presumably because of its slightly larger size. It certainly gave the impression of being crowded. M. Bouc himself was sitting on the small seat in the opposite corner. In the corner next the window, facing him, was a small dark man looking out at the snow. Standing up and quite 25Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS preventing. Poirot from advancing any farther were a big man in blue uniform (the chef de train) and his own. Wagon. Lit conductor. “Ah! my good friend,” cried. M. Bouc. “Come in. We have need of you.”. The little man in the window shifted along the seat, and. Poirot squeezed past: the other two men and sat down facing his friend. The expression on. M. Bouc’s face gave him, as he would have expressed it, furiously to think. It was clear that something out of the common had happened. “What has occurred?” he asked. “You may well ask that. First this snow-this stoppage. And now—”. He paused—and a sort of strangled gasp came from the. Wagon. Lit conductor. “And now what?” “And now a passenger lies dead in his berth—stabbed.”. M. Bouc spoke with a kind of calm desperation. “A passenger? Which passenger?” “An. American. A man called—called—” he consulted some notes in front of him. “Ratchett. That is right—Ratchett?” “Yes,. Monsieur,” the. Wagon. Lit man gulped. Poirot looked at him. He was as white as chalk. “You had better let that man sit down,” he said. “He may faint otherwise.”. The chef de train moved slightly and the. Wagon. Lit man sank down in the corner and buried his face in his hands. “Brr!” said. Poirot. “This is serious!” “Certainly it is serious. To begin with, a murder—that in itself is a calamity of the first water. But not only that, the circumstances are unusual. Here we are, brought to a standstill. We may be here for hours—and not only hours—days! Another circumstance—passing through most countries we have the police of that country on the train. But in. Jugo-Slavia, no. You comprehend?” “It is a position of great difficulty,” said. Poirot. “There is worse to come. Dr. Constantine—I forgot,. I have not introduced you. Dr. Constantine,. M. Poirot.”. The little dark man bowed, and. Poirot returned the bow. “Dr. Constantine is of the opinion that death occurred at about 1. A.M.” “It is difficult to speak exactly in these matters,” said the doctor, “but. I think. I can say definitely that death occurred between midnight and two in the morning.” “When was this. M. Ratchett last seen alive?” asked. Poirot. “He is known to have been alive at about twenty minutes to one, when he spoke to the conductor,” said. M. Bouc. “That is quite correct,” said. Poirot. “I myself heard what passed. That is the last thing known?” “Yes.”. Poirot turned toward the doctor, who continued. “The window of. M. Ratchett’s compartment was found wide open, leading one to suppose that the murderer escaped that way. But in my opinion that open window is a blind. Anyone departing that way would have left distinct traces in the snow. There were none.” “The crime was discovered—when?” asked. Poirot. “Michel!” 26Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS. The. Wagon. Lit conductor sat up. His face still looked pale and frightened. “Tell this gentleman exactly what occurred,” ordered. M. Bouc. The man spoke somewhat jerkily. “The valet of this. M. Ratchett, he tapped several times at the door this morning. There was no answer. Then, half an hour ago, the restaurant car attendant came. He wanted to know if. Monsieur was taking déjeuner. It was eleven o’clock, you comprehend. “I open the door for him with my key. But there is a chain, too, and that is fastened. There is no answer and it is very still in there, and cold—but cold. With the window open and snow drifting in. I thought the gentleman had had a fit, perhaps. I got the chef de train. We broke the chain and went in. He was—Ah! c’était terrible!”. He buried his face in his hands again. “The door was locked and chained on the inside,” said. Poirot thoughtfully. “It was not suicide—eh?”. The. Greek doctor gave a sardonic laugh. “Does a man who commits suicide stab himself in ten—twelve—fifteen places?” he asked. Poirot’s eyes opened. “That is great ferocity,” he said. “It is a woman,” said the chef de train, speaking for the first time. “Depend upon it, it was a woman. Only a woman would stab like that.”. Dr. Constantine screwed up his face thoughtfully. “She must have been a very strong woman,” he said. “It is not my desire to speak technically—that is only confusing; but. I can assure you that one or two of the blows were delivered with such force as to drive them through hard belts of bone and muscle.” “It was clearly not a scientific crime,” said. Poirot. “It was most unscientific,” returned. Dr. Constantine. “The blows seem to have been delivered haphazard and at random. Some have glanced off, doing hardly any damage. It is as though somebody had shut his eyes and then in a frenzy struck blindly again and again.” “C’est une femme,” said the chef de train again. “Women are like that. When they are enraged they have great strength.”. He nodded so sagely that everyone suspected a personal experience of his own. “I have, perhaps, something to contribute to your store of knowledge,” said. Poirot. “M. Ratchett spoke to me yesterday. He told me, as far as. I was able to understand him, that he was in danger of his life.” “ ‘Bumped off’—that is the. American expression, is it not?” asked. M. Bouc. “Then it is not a woman. It is a ‘gangster’ or a ‘gunman.’ ”. The chef de train looked pained at seeing his theory come to nought. “If so,” said. Poirot, “it seems to have been done very amateurishly.”. His tone expressed professional disapproval. “There is a large. American on the train,.” said. M. Bouc, pursuing his idea. “A common- looking man with terrible clothes. He chews the gum, which. I believe is not done in good circles. You know whom. I mean?”. The. Wagon. Lit conductor to whom he had appealed nodded. “Oui,. Monsieur, the. No. 16. But it cannot have been he. I should have seen him enter or leave the compartment.” “You might not. You might not. But we will go into that presently. The question is, what to do?”. He looked at. Poirot. Poirot looked back at him. 27Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “Come, my friend,” said. M. Bouc. “You comprehend what. I am about to ask of you. I know your powers. Take command of this investigation! No, no, do not refuse. See, to us it is serious—I speak for the. Compagnie. Internationale des. Wagons. Lits. By the time the. Jugo-. Slavian police arrive, how simple if we can present them with the solution! Otherwise delays, annoyances, a million and one inconveniences. Perhaps, who knows, serious annoyance to innocent persons. Instead—you solve the mystery! We say, ‘A murder has occurred—this is the criminal!’” “And suppose. I do not solve it?” “Ah, mon cher!”. M. Bouc’s voice became positively caressing. “I know your reputation. I know something of your methods. This is the ideal case for you. To look up the antecedents of all these people, to discover their bona fides—all that takes time and endless inconvenience. But have. I not heard you say often that to solve a case a man has only to lie back in his chair and think? Do that. Interview the passengers on the train, view the body, examine what clues there are, and then—well,. I have faith in you! I am assured that it is no idle boast of yours. Lie back and think—use (as. I have heard you say so often) the little grey cells of the mind—and you will know!”. He leaned forward, looking affectionately at the detective. “Your faith touches me, my friend,” said. Poirot emotionally. “As you say, this cannot be a difficult case. I myself last night—but we will not speak of that now. In truth, this problem intrigues me. I was reflecting, not half an hour ago, that many hours of boredom lay ahead whilst we are stuck here. And now—a problem lies ready to my hand.” “You accept then?” said. M. Bouc eagerly. “C’est entendu. You place the matter in my hands.” “Good—we are all at your service.” “To begin with,. I should like a plan of the. Istanbul-Calais coach, with a note of the people who occupied the several compartments, and. I should also like to see their passports and their tickets.” “Michel will get you those.”. The. Wagon. Lit conductor left the compartment. “What other passengers are there on the train?” asked. Poirot. “In this coach. Dr. Constantine and. I are the only travellers. In the coach from. Bucharest is an old gentleman with a lame leg. He is well known to the conductor. Beyond that are the ordinary carriages, but these do not concern us, since they were locked after dinner had been served last night. Forward of the. Istanbul-Calais coach there is only the dining-car.” “Then it seems,” said. Poirot slowly, “as though we must look for our murderer in the. Istanbul-Calais coach.”. He turned to the doctor. “That is what you were hinting,. I think?”. The. Greek nodded. “At half an hour after midnight we ran into the snowdrift. No one can have left the train since then.”. M. Bouc said solemnly, “The murderer is with us—on the train now. ...” 28Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS 6. A. WOMAN “First of all,” said. Poirot, “I should like a word or two with young. Mr. MacQueen. He may be able to give us valuable information.” “Certainly,” said. M. Bouc. He turned to the chef de train. “Get. Mr. MacQueen to come here.”. The chef de train left the carriage. The conductor returned with a bundle of passports and tickets. M. Bouc took them from him. “Thank you,. Michel. It would be best now,. I think, if you were to go back to your post. We will take your evidence formally later.” “Very good,. Monsieur,” said. Michel, and in his turn left the carriage. “After we have seen young. MacQueen,” said. Poirot, “perhaps. M. le docteur will come with me to the dead man’s carriage.” “Certainly.” “After we have finished there—”. But at this moment the chef de train returned with. Hector. MacQueen. M. Bouc rose. “We are a little cramped here,” he said pleasantly. “Take my seat,. Mr. MacQueen. M. Poirot will sit opposite you—so.”. He turned to the chef de train. “Clear all the people out of the restaurant car,” he said, “and let it be left free for. M. Poirot. You will conduct your interviews there, mon cher?” “It would be the most convenient, yes,” agreed. Poirot. MacQueen had stood looking from one to the other, not quite following the rapid flow of. French. “Qu’est-ce qu’il y a?” he began laboriously. “Pourquoi—?”. With a vigorous gesture. Poirot motioned him to the seat in the corner. He took it and began once more. “Pourquoi—?”. Then checking himself and relapsing into his own tongue: “What’s up on the train? Has anything happened?”. He looked from one man to another. Poirot nodded. “Exactly. Something has happened. Prepare yourself for a shock. Your employer,. M. Ratchett, is dead!”. MacQueen’s mouth pursed itself into a whistle. Except that his eyes grew a shade brighter, he showed no signs of shock or distress. “So they got him after all,” he said. “What exactly do you mean by that phrase,. Mr. MacQueen?”. MacQueen hesitated. “You are assuming,” said. Poirot, “that. M. Ratchett was murdered?” “Wasn’t he?”. This time. MacQueen did show surprise. “Why, yes,” he said slowly. “That’s just what. I did think. Do you mean he just died in his sleep? Why, the old man was as tough as— as tough—”. He stopped, at a loss for a simile. “No, no,” said. Poirot. “Your assumption was quite right. M. Ratchett was murdered. Stabbed. But. I should like to know why you were so sure it was murder, and not just—death.” 29Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS. MacQueen hesitated. “I must get this clear,” he said. “Who exactly are you? And where do you come in?” “I represent the. Compagnie. Internationale des. Wagons. Lits.”. Poirot paused, then added, “I am a detective. My name is. Hercule. Poirot.”. If he expected an effect he did not get one. MacQueen said merely, “Oh! yes?” and waited for him to go on. “You know the name perhaps?” “Why, it does seem kind of familiar. Only. I always thought it was a woman’s dressmaker.”. Hercule. Poirot looked at him with distaste. “It is incredible!” he said. “What’s incredible?” “Nothing. Let us advance with the matter in hand. I want you to tell me,. M. MacQueen, all that you know about the dead man. You were not related to him?” “No. I am—was—his secretary.” “For how long have you held that post?” “Just over a year.” “Please give me all the information you can.” “Well,. I met. Mr. Ratchett just over a year ago when. I was in. Persia—”. Poirot interrupted. “What were you doing there?’ “I had come over from. New. York to look into an oil concession. I don’t suppose you want to hear all about that. My friends and. I had been let in rather badly over it. Mr. Ratchett was in the same hotel. He had just had a row with his secretary. He offered me the job and. I took it. I was at a loose end and glad to find a well-paid job ready made, as it were.” “And since then?” “We’ve travelled about. Mr. Ratchett wanted to see the world. He was hampered by knowing no languages. I acted more as a courier than as a secretary. It was a pleasant life.” “Now tell me as much as you can about your employer.”. The young man shrugged his shoulders. A perplexed expression passed over his face. “That’s not so easy.” “What was his full name?” “Samuel. Edward. Ratchett.” “He was an. American citizen?” “Yes.” “What part of. America did he come from?” “I don’t know.” “Well, tell me what you do know.” “The actual truth is,. Mr. Poirot, that. I know nothing at all! Mr. Ratchett never spoke of himself or of his life in. America.” “Why do you think that was?” “I don’t know. I imagined that he might be ashamed of his beginnings. Some men are.” “Does that strike you as a satisfactory solution?” “Frankly, it doesn’t.” “Has he any relatives?” “He never mentioned any.”. Poirot pressed the point. “You must have formed some theory,. Mr. MacQueen.” 30Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “Well,. Yes,. I did. For one thing,. I don’t believe. Ratchett was his real name. I think he left. America definitely in order to escape someone or something. I think he was successful—until a few weeks ago.” “And then?” “He began to get letters—threatening letters.” “Did you see them?” “Yes. It was my business to attend to his correspondence. The first letter came a fortnight ago.” “Were these letters destroyed?” “No,. I think. I’ve got a couple still in my files—one. I know. Ratchett tore up in a rage. Shall. I get them for you?” “If you would be so good.”. MacQueen left the compartment. He returned a few minutes later and laid down two sheets of rather dirty notepaper before. Poirot. The first letter ran as follows:. Thought you’d double-cross us and get away with it, did you? Not on your life. We’re out to. GET you,. Ratchett, and we. WILL get you! There was no signature. With no comment beyond raised eyebrows,. Poirot picked up the second letter. We’re going to take you for a ride,. Ratchett. Some time soon. We’re going to. GET you— see? Poirot laid the letter down. “The style is monotonous!” he said. “More so than the handwriting.”. MacQueen stared at him. “You would not observe,” said. Poirot pleasantly. “It requires the eye of one used to such things. This letter was not written by one person,. M. MacQueen. Two or more persons wrote it— each writing one letter of a word at a time. Also, the letters are printed. That makes the task of identifying the handwriting much more difficult.”. He paused, then said: “Did you know that. M. Ratchett had applied for help to me?” “To you?”. MacQueen’s astonished tone told. Poirot quite certainly that the young man had not known of it. The detective nodded. “Yes. He was alarmed. Tell me, how did he act when he received the first letter?”. MacQueen hesitated. “It’s difficult to say. He—he—passed it off with a laugh in that quiet way of his. But somehow—” he gave a slight shiver—“I felt that there was a good deal going on underneath the quietness.”. Poirot nodded. Then he asked an unexpected question. “Mr. MacQueen, will you tell me, quite honestly, exactly how you regarded your employer? Did you like him?”. Hector. MacQueen took a moment or two before replying. 31Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “No,” he said at last. “I did not.” “Why.” “I can’t exactly say. He was always quite pleasant in his manner.”. He paused, then said: “I’ll tell you the truth,. Mr. Poirot. I disliked and distrusted him. He was,. I am sure, a cruel and dangerous man. I must admit, though, that. I have no reasons to advance for my opinion.” “Thank you,. Mr. MacQueen. One further question: when did you last see. Mr. Ratchett alive?” “Last evening about—” he thought for a minute—“ten o’clock,. I should say. I went into his compartment to take down some memoranda from him.” “On what subject?” “Some tiles and antique pottery that he bought in. Persia. What had been delivered was not what he had purchased. There has been a long, vexatious correspondence on the subject.” “And that was the last time. Mr. Ratchett was seen alive?” “Yes,. I suppose so.” “Do you know when. Mr. Ratchett received the last threatening letter?” “On the morning of the day we left. Constantinople.” “There is one more question. I must ask you,. Mr. MacQueen. Were you on good terms with your employer?”. The young man’s eyes twinkled suddenly. “This is where. I’m supposed to go all goosefleshy down the back. In the words of a best seller, ‘You’ve nothing on me.’. Ratchett and. I were on perfectly good terms.” “Perhaps,. Mr. MacQueen, you will give me your full name and your address in. America.”. MacQueen gave his name—Hector. Willard. MacQueen—and an address in. New. York. Poirot leaned back against the cushions. “That is all for the present,. Mr. MacQueen,” he said. “I should be obliged if you would keep the matter of. Mr. Ratchett’s death to yourself for a little time.” “His valet,. Masterman, will have to know.” “He probably knows already,” said. Poirot drily. “If so, try to get him to hold his tongue.” “That oughtn’t to be difficult. He’s a. Britisher and, as he calls it, he ‘keeps to himself.’. He has a low opinion of. Americans, and no opinion at all of any other nationality.” “Thank you,. Mr. MacQueen.”. The. American left the carriage. “Well?” demanded. M. Bouc. “You believe what he says, this young man?” “He seems honest and straightforward. He did not pretend to any affection for his employer, as he probably would have done had he been involved in any way. It is true,. Mr. Ratchett did not tell him that he had tried to enlist my services and failed, but. I do not think that that is really a suspicious circumstance. I fancy. Mr. Ratchett was a gentleman who kept his own counsel on every possible occasion.” “So you pronounce one person at least innocent of the crime,” said. M. Bouc jovially. Poirot cast on him a look of reproach. “Me,. I suspect everybody till the last minute,” he said. “All the same,. I must admit that. I cannot see this sober, long-headed. MacQueen losing his head and stabbing his victim twelve or fourteen times. It is not in accord with his psychology—not at all.” “No,” said. M. Bouc thoughtfully. “That is the act of a man driven almost crazy with a frenzied hate—it suggests rather the. Latin temperament. Or else it suggests, as our friend the chef de train insisted—a woman.” 32Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS 7. THE. BODY. Followed by. Dr. Constantine,. Poirot made his way to the next coach and to the compartment occupied by the murdered man. The conductor came and unlocked the door for them with his key. The two men passed inside. Poirot turned inquiringly to his companion. “How much has been disarranged in this compartment?” “Nothing has been touched. I was careful not to move the body in making my examination.”. Poirot nodded. He looked round him. The first thing that struck the senses was the intense cold. The window was pushed down as far as it would go, and the blind was drawn up. “Brrr,” observed. Poirot. The other smiled appreciatively. “I did not like to close it,” he said. Poirot examined the window carefully. “You are right,” he announced. “Nobody left the carriage this way. Possibly the open window was intended to suggest that somebody did; but if so, the snow has defeated the murderer’s intention.”. He examined the frame of the window carefully. Taking a small case from his pocket he blew a little powder over the frame. “No fingerprints at all,” he said. “That means it: has been wiped. Well, if there had been fingerprints they would have told us very little. They would have been those of. Mr. Ratchett or his valet or the conductor. Criminals do not make mistakes of that kind nowadays. “And that being so,” he added cheerfully, “we might as well shut the window. Positively it is the cold storage in here!”. He suited the action to the word and then turned his attention for the first time to the motionless figure lying in the bunk. Ratchett lay on his back. His pyjama jacket, stained with rusty patches, had been unbuttoned and thrown back. “I had to see the nature of the wounds, you see,” explained the doctor. Poirot nodded. He bent over the body. Finally he straightened himself with a slight grimace. “It is not pretty,” he said. “Someone must have stood there and stabbed him again and again. How many wounds are there exactly?” “I make it twelve. One or two are so slight as to be practically scratches. On the other hand, at least three would be capable of causing death.”. Something in the doctor’s tone caught. Poirot’s attention. He looked at him sharply. The little. Greek was standing staring down at the body with a puzzled frown. “Something strikes you as odd, does it not?” he asked gently. “Speak, my friend. There is something here that puzzles you?” “You are right,” acknowledged the other. “What is it?” 33Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “You see these two wounds—here and here—”. He pointed. “They are deep. Each cut must have severed blood vessels—and yet the edges do not gape. They have not bled as one would have expected.” “Which suggests?” “That the man was already dead—some little time dead—when they were delivered. But that is surely absurd.” “It would seem so,” said. Poirot thoughtfully. “Unless our murderer figured to himself that he had not accomplished his job properly and came back to make quite sure—but that is manifestly absurd! Anything else?” “Well, just one thing.” “And that?” “You see this wound here—under the right arm—near the right shoulder. Take this pencil of mine. Could you deliver such a blow?”. Poirot poised his hand. “Précisément,” he said. “I see. With the right hand it is exceedingly difficult, almost impossible. One would have to strike backhanded, as it were. But if the blow were struck with the left hand—” “Exactly,. M. Poirot. That blow was almost certainly struck with the left hand.” “So that our murderer is left-handed? No, it is more difficult than that, is it not?” “As you say,. M. Poirot. Some of these other blows are just as obviously right-handed.” “Two people. We are back at two people again,” murmured the detective. He asked abruptly: “Was the electric light on?” “It is difficult to say. You see, it is turned off by the conductor every morning about ten o’clock.” “The switches will tell us,” said. Poirot. He examined the switch of the top light and also the roll-back bed-head light. The former was turned off. The latter was closed. “Eh bien,” he said thoughtfully. “We have here a hypothesis of the. First and the. Second. Murderer, as the great. Shakespeare would put it. The. First. Murderer stabbed his victim and left the compartment, turning off the light. The. Second. Murderer came in in the dark, did not see that his or her work had been done, and stabbed at least twice at a dead body. Que pensez-vous de ça?” “Magnificent!” said the little doctor with enthusiasm. The other’s eyes twinkled. “You think so? I am glad. It sounded to me a little like the nonsense.” “What other explanation can there be?” “That is just what. I am asking myself. Have we here a coincidence, or what? Are there any other inconsistencies, such as would point to two people being concerned?” “I think. I can say yes. Some of these blows, as. I have already said, point to a weakness—a lack of strength or a lack of determination. They are feeble, glancing blows. But this one here— and this one—”. Again he pointed. “Great strength was needed for those blows. They have penetrated the muscle.” “They were, in your opinion, delivered by a man?” “Most certainly.” “They could not have been delivered by a woman?” 34Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “A young, vigorous, athletic woman might have struck them, especially if she were in the grip of a strong emotion; but it is in my opinion highly unlikely.”. Poirot was silent a moment or two. The other asked anxiously, “You understand my point?” “Perfectly,” said. Poirot. “The matter begins to clear itself up wonderfully! The murderer was a man of great strength—he was feeble—it was a woman—it was a right-handed person—it was a left-handed person. Ah! c’est rigolo, tout ça!”. He spoke with sudden anger. “And the victim— what does he do in all this? Does he cry out? Does he struggle? Does he defend himself?”. He slipped his hand under the pillow and drew out the automatic pistol which. Ratchett had shown him the day before. “Fully loaded, you see,” he said. They looked round them. Ratchett’s day clothing was hanging from the hooks on the wall. On the small table formed by the lid of the wash basin were various objects. False teeth in a glass of water. Another glass, empty. A bottle of mineral water. A large flask. An ash-tray containing the butt of a cigar and some charred fragments of paper; also two burnt matches. The doctor picked up the empty glass and sniffed it. “Here is the explanation of the victim’s inertia,” he said quietly. “Drugged?” “Yes.”. Poirot nodded. He picked up the two matches and scrutinised them carefully. “You have a clue then?” demanded the little doctor eagerly. “Those two matches are of different shapes,” said. Poirot. “One is flatter than the other. You see?” “It is the kind you get on the train,” said the doctor. “In paper covers.”. Poirot was feeling in the pockets of. Ratchett’s clothing. Presently he pulled out a box of matches. He compared them carefully with the burnt ones. “The rounder one is a match struck by. Mr. Ratchett,” he said. “Let us see if he had also the flatter kind.”. But a further search showed no other matches. Poirot’s eyes were darting about the compartment. They were bright and sharp like a bird’s. One felt that nothing could escape their scrutiny. With a little exclamation he bent and picked-up something from the floor. It was a small square of cambric, very dainty. In the corner was an embroidered initial—H. “A woman’s handkerchief,” said the doctor. “Our friend the chef de train was right. There is a woman concerned in this.” “And most conveniently she leaves her handkerchief behind!” said. Poirot. “Exactly as it happens in the books and on the films—and to make things even easier for us, it is marked with an initial.” “What a stroke of luck for us!” exclaimed the doctor. “Is it not?” said. Poirot. Something in his tone surprised the doctor, but before he could ask for elucidation. Poirot had made another dive onto the floor. This time he held out on the palm of his hand—a pipe-cleaner. “It is perhaps the property of. Mr. Ratchett?” suggested the doctor. “There was no pipe in any of his pockets, and no tobacco or tobacco pouch.” “Then it is a clue.” 35Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “Oh! decidedly. And again dropped most conveniently. A masculine clue, this time, you note! One cannot complain of having no clues in this case. There are clues here in abundance. By the way, what have you done with the weapon?” “There was no sign of any weapon. The murderer must have taken it away with him.” “I wonder why,” mused. Poirot. “Ah!”. The doctor had been delicately exploring the pyjama pockets of the dead man. “I overlooked this,” he said. “I unbuttoned the jacket and threw it straight back.”. From the breast pocket he brought out a gold watch. The case was dented savagely, and the hands pointed to a quarter past one. “You see?” cried. Constantine eagerly. “This gives us the hour of the crime. It agrees with my calculations. Between midnight and two in the morning is what. I said, and probably about one o’clock, though it is difficult to be exact in these matters. Eh bien, here is confirmation. A quarter past one. That was the hour of the crime.” “It is possible, yes. It is certainly possible.”. The doctor looked at him curiously. “You will pardon me,. M. Poirot, but. I do not quite understand you.” “I do not understand myself,” said. Poirot. “I understand nothing at all. And, as you perceive, it worries me.”. He sighed and bent over the little table examining the charred fragment of paper. He murmured to himself, “What. I need at this moment is an old-fashioned woman’s hat-box.”. Dr. Constantine was at a loss to know what to make of this singular remark. In any case. Poirot gave him no time for questions. Opening the door into the corridor, he called for the conductor. The man arrived at a run. “How many women are there in this coach?”. The conductor counted on his fingers. “One, two, three—six,. Monsieur. The old. American lady, a. Swedish lady, the young. English lady, the. Countess. Andrenyi, and. Madame la. Princesse. Dragomiroff and her maid.”. Poirot considered. “They all have hat-boxes, yes?” “Yes,. Monsieur.” “Then bring me—let me see—yes, the. Swedish lady’s and that of the lady’s-maid. Those two are the only hope. You will tell them it is a customs regulation—something—anything that occurs to you.” “That will be all right,. Monsieur. Neither lady is in her compartment at the moment.” “Then be quick.”. The conductor departed. He returned with the two hatboxes. Poirot opened that of the maid, and tossed it aside. Then he opened the. Swedish lady’s and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction. Removing the hats carefully, he disclosed round humps of wire-netting. “Ah, here is what we need! About fifteen years ago hat-boxes were made like this. You skewered through the hat with a hatpin on to this hump of wire-netting.”. As he spoke he was skillfully removing two of the attached humps. Then he repacked the hat- box and told the conductor to return both boxes where they belonged. When the door was shut once more he turned to his companion. “See you, my dear doctor, me,. I am not one to rely upon the expert procedure. It is the psychology. I seek, not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash. But in this case. I would welcome a 36Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS little scientific assistance. This compartment is full of clues, but can. I be sure that those clues are really what they seem to be?” “I do not quite understand you,. M. Poirot.” “Well, to give you an example—we find a woman’s handkerchief. Did a woman drop it? Or did a man, committing the crime, say to himself: ‘I will make this look like a woman’s crime. I will stab my enemy an unnecessary number of times, making some of the blows feeble and ineffective, and. I will drop this handkerchief where no one can miss it’? That is one possibility. Then there is another. Did a woman kill him, and did she deliberately drop a pipe-cleaner to make it look like a man’s work? Or are we seriously to suppose that two people, a man and a woman, were separately concerned, and that each was so careless as to drop a clue to his or her identity? It is a little too much of a coincidence, that!” “But where does the hat-box come in?” asked the doctor, still puzzled. “Ah! I am coming to that. As. I say, these clues—the watch stopped at a quarter past one, the handkerchief, the pipe-cleaner—they may be genuine, or they may be faked. As to that. I cannot yet tell. But there is one clue here which—though again. I may be wrong—I believe has not been faked. I mean this flat match,. M. le docteur. I believe that that match was used by the murderer, not by. Mr. Ratchett. It was used to burn an incriminating paper of some kind. Possibly a note. If so, there was something in that note, some mistake, some error, that left a possible clue to the assailant. I am going to try to discover what that something was.”. He went out of the compartment and returned a few moments later with a small spirit stove and a pair of curling-tongs. “I use them for the moustaches,” he said, referring to the latter. The doctor watched him with great interest. Poirot flattened out the two humps of wire, and with great care wriggled the charred scrap of paper on to one of them. He clapped the other on top of it and then, holding both pieces together with the tongs, held the whole thing over the flame of the spirit-lamp. “It is a very makeshift affair, this,” he said over his shoulder. “Let us hope that it will answer our purpose.”. The doctor watched the proceedings attentively. The metal began to glow. Suddenly he saw faint indications of letters. Words formed themselves slowly-words of fire. It was a very tiny scrap. Only three words and part of another showed. —member little. Daisy. Armstrong “Ah!”. Poirot gave a sharp exclamation. “It tells you something?” asked the doctor. Poirot’s eyes were shining. He laid down the tongs carefully. “Yes,” he said. “I know the dead man’s real name. I know why he had to leave. America.” “What was his name?” “Cassetti.” “Cassetti?”. Constantine knitted his brows. “It brings back to me something. Some years ago. I cannot remember. ... It was a case in. America, was it not?” “Yes,” said. Poirot. “A case in. America.”. Further than that. Poirot was not disposed to be communicative. He looked round him as he went on: 37Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS “We will go into all that presently. Let us first make sure that we have seen all there is to be seen here.”. Quickly and deftly he went once more through the pockets of the dead man’s clothes but found nothing there of interest. He tried the communicating door which led through to the next compartment, but it was bolted on the other side. “There is one thing that. I do not understand,” said. Dr. Constantine. “If the murderer did not escape through the window, and if this communicating door was bolted on the other side, and if the door into the corridor was not only locked on the inside but chained, how then did the murderer leave the compartment?” “That is what the audience says when a person bound hand and foot is shut into a cabinet— and disappears.” “You mean—?” “I mean,” explained. Poirot, “that if the murderer intended us to believe that he had escaped by way of the window, he would naturally make it appear that the other two exits were impossible. Like the ‘disappearing person’ in the cabinet, it is a trick. It is our business to find out how the trick is done. He locked the communicating door on their side—“in case,” he said, “the excellent. Mrs. Hubbard should take it into her head to acquire first-hand details of the crime to write to her daughter.”. He looked round once more. “There is nothing more to do here,. I think. Let us rejoin. M. Bouc.” 38Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS 8. THE. ARMSTRONG. KIDNAPPING. CASE. They found. M. Bouc finishing an omelet. “I thought it best to have lunch served immediately in the restaurant car,” he said. “Afterwards it will be cleared and. M. Poirot can conduct his examination of the passengers there. In the meantime. I have ordered them to bring us three some food here.” “An excellent idea,” said. Poirot. None of the three men was hungry, and the meal was soon eaten; but not till they were sipping their coffee did. M. Bouc mention the subject that was occupying all their minds. “Eh bien?” he asked. “Eh bien,. I have discovered the identity of the victim. I know why it was imperative he should leave. America.” “Who was he?” “Do you remember reading of the. Armstrong baby? This is the man who murdered little. Daisy. Armstrong. Cassetti.” “I recall it now. A shocking affair—though. I cannot remember the details.” “Colonel. Armstrong was an. Englishman—a. V.C. He was half. American, his mother having been a daughter of. W. K. Van der. Halt, the. Wall. Street millionaire. He married the daughter of. Linda. Arden, the most famous tragic. American actress of her day. They lived in. America and had one child—a girl whom they idolized. When she was three years old she was kidnapped, and an impossibly high sum demanded as the price of her return. I will not weary you with all the intricacies that followed. I will come to the moment when, after the parents had paid over the enormous sum of two hundred thousand dollars, the child’s dead body was discovered; it had been dead for at least a fortnight. Public indignation rose to fever point. And there was worse to follow. Mrs. Armstrong was expecting another baby. Following the shock of the discovery, she gave birth prematurely to a dead child, and herself died. Her broken-hearted husband shot himself.” “Mon. Dieu, what a tragedy. I remember now,” said. M. Bouc. “There was also another death, if. I remember rightly?” “Yes, an unfortunate. French or. Swiss nursemaid. The police were convinced that she had some knowledge of the crime. They refused to believe her hysterical denials. Finally, in a fit of despair the poor girl threw herself from a window and was killed. It was proved afterwards that she had been absolutely innocent of any complicity in the crime.” “It is not good to think of,” said. M. Bouc. “About six months later, this man. Cassetti was arrested as the head of the gang who had kidnapped the child. They had used the same methods in the past. If the police seemed likely to get on their trail, they killed their prisoner, hid the body, and continued to extract as much money as possible before the crime was discovered. “Now,. I will make clear to you this, my friend. Cassetti was the man! But by means of the enormous wealth he had piled up, and owing to the secret hold he had over various persons, he was acquitted on some technical inaccuracy. Notwithstanding that, he would have been lynched by the populace had he not been clever enough to give them the slip. It is now clear to me what 39Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS happened. He changed his name and left. America. Since then he has been a gentleman of leisure, travelling abroad and living on his rentes.” “Ah! quel animal!”. M. Bouc’s tone was redolent of heartfelt disgust. “I cannot regret that he is dead—not at all!” “I agree with you.” “Tout de même, it is not necessary that he should be killed on the. Orient. Express. There are other places.”. Poirot smiled a little. He realised that. M. Bouc was biased in the matter. “The question we have now to ask ourselves is this,” he said. “Is this murder the work of some rival gang whom. Cassetti had double-crossed in the past, or is it an act of private vengeance?”. He explained his discovery of the few words on the charred fragment of paper. “If. I am right in my assumption, then, the letter was burnt by the murderer. Why? Because it mentioned the name ‘Armstrong,’ which is the clue to the mystery.” “Are there any members of the. Armstrong family living?” “That, unfortunately,. I do not know. I think. I remember reading of a younger sister of. Mrs. Armstrong’s.”. Poirot went on to relate the joint conclusions of himself and. Dr. Constantine. M. Bouc brightened at the mention of the broken watch. “That seems to give us the time of the crime very exactly.” “Yes,” said. Poirot. “It is very convenient.”. There was an indescribable something in his tone that made both the other two look at him curiously. “You say that you yourself heard. Ratchett speak to the conductor at twenty minutes to one?” asked. M. Bouc. Poirot related just what had occurred. “Well,” said. M. Bouc, “that proves at least that. Cassetti—or. Ratchett, as. I shall continue to call him—was certainly alive at twenty minutes to one.” “Twenty-three minutes to one, to be precise.” ‘Then at twelve thirty-seven, to put it formally,. Mr. Ratchett was alive. That is one fact, at least.”. Poirot did not reply. He sat looking thoughtfully in front of him. There was a tap on the door and the restaurant attendant entered. “The restaurant car is free now,. Monsieur,” he said. “We will go there,” said. M. Bouc, rising. “I may accompany you?” asked. Constantine. “Certainly, my dear doctor. Unless. M. Poirot has any objection?” “Not at all. Not at all,” said. Poirot. After a little politeness in the matter of precedence—“Après vous,. Monsieur”—“Mais non, après vous”—they left the compartment. 40Agatha. Christie (cid:153). MURDER. ON. THE. ORIENT. EXPRESS. PART. II. THE. EVIDENCE 1. THE. EVIDENCE. OF. THE. WAGON. LIT. CONDUCTOR. In the restaurant car all was in readiness. Poirot and. M. Bouc sat together on one side of a table. The doctor sat across the aisle. On the table in front of. Poirot was a plan of the. Istanbul-Calais coach with the names of the passengers marked in red ink. The passports and tickets were in a pile at one side. There was writing paper, ink, pen, and pencils. “Excellent,” said. Poirot. “We can open our. Court of. Inquiry without more ado. First,. I think, we should take the evidence of the. Wagon. Lit conductor. You probably know something about the man. What character has he? Is he a man on whose word you would place reliance?” “I should say so, most assuredly. Pierre. Michel has been employed by the company for over fifteen years. He is a. Frenchman—lives near. Calais. Thoroughly respectable and honest. Not, perhaps, remarkable for brains.”. Poirot nodded comprehendingly. “Good,” he said. “Let us see him.” 41\n"
